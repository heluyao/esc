One of the first calls will be to the insurers. Traditional wisdom has it that now would be a good time to buy in to the insurance sector, as big losses are swiftly followed by higher premiums and, eventually, higher profits. According to Credit Suisse, US reinsurers outperformed US non-financials in the year after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the Northridge Earthquake in 1994 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. <\/p><p>This time is different, though. It is early days, but risk modellers are estimating the insured loss to be between $7bn and $20bn, well ahead of the $4bn-$5bn suffered after Hurricane Irene last year. That will not worry the reinsurers too much \u2013 their coverage only tends to start once the loss has passed $10bn so their portion of the total will be relatively low. The primary insurers are more exposed, so the likes of State Farm, Allstate and Travelers, which have big market shares in the affected areas, will be the ones to watch. Much will depend on how much damage was caused by wind (covered by insurers) and how much by floods (covered by the government).<\/p><p>Prices have already been rising, driven by global catastrophe losses and poor weather in the US in 2011. US property catastrophe insurance prices are up 7 per cent this year according to insurance advisory group Guy Carpenter. On top of that, the sector as a whole is well-capitalised thanks to rising earnings (until Sandy, 2012 had been a relatively benign year for weather losses) and a more conservative investment attitude across the sector. <\/p><p>Sandy-related losses will dent earnings this year \u2013 Morgan Stanley has cut fourth-quarter earnings per share estimates for the property and casualty sector by 26 per cent \u2013 but are not likely to damage materially the industry\u2019s capital position. And the more capital there is chasing business, the less scope there is for premiums to rise, and share prices to follow them.<\/p><p>Email the Lex team in confidence at <a onclick=\"if (mFT.mailto) return mFT.mailto('lex@ft.com')\" href=\"mailto:lex@ft.com\">lex@ft.com<\/a><\/p>"},{"id":"33711831","uuid":"0587bce6-24c2-11e2-8924-00144feabdc0","title":"Li & Fung \u2013 mystery shopper","catid":"57","byline":"","datepublished":"Sun, 04 Nov 2012 18:32:35 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/3\/0587bce6-24c2-11e2-8924-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"Sourcing group has made 33 acquisitions in the past four years and there could be more on the way, but their impact on the business is unclear","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Lex"},"share":{"webappemail":"Ts10YV","webappshare":"XbBgoA"},"stocks":{"us:TGT":"Target Corp","hk:494":"Li Fung Ltd","us:WMT":"Wal-Mart Stores Inc"},"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Sun, 04 Nov 2012 18:32:35 +0000","content":"<p> It is easy to get addicted to deals: buying growth can produce spectacular numbers.

The BBC did not suggest that ISS was breaking the law and there is no evidence that ISS is one of the companies being investigated by the Revenue. ISS said it was \u201cmeticulous in complying with HMRC codes on taxes and expenses\u201d. It told the BBC that HMRC had no grounds to challenge its employees or business partners.<\/p><p>The issue of avoidance will be raised by MPs when senior Revenue officials appear before the Public Accounts Committee on Monday. Margaret Hodge, who chairs the committee said: \u201cThese are allegations I will want to look at. There is growing concern that companies are not paying their fair share of taxes.\u201d<\/p><p>Richard Murphy, director of Tax Research UK, told the BBC the growth of \u201cumbrella\u201d companies was \u201cthe next big UK tax scandal\u201d. At least 150,000 workers are estimated to use such companies, which are set up to pay the salaries and expenses of temporary workers, particularly in engineering, IT and construction. <\/p><p>Recruitment agencies sometimes insist workers use the schemes because there is no requirement to deduct the worker\u2019s income tax and NICs, or to pay employer\u2019s NICs on the worker\u2019s fee \u2013 as this is the responsibility of the umbrella company \u2013 which may suppress the rates charged to end clients.<\/p><p>HMRC said it was unable to comment on individual cases or employment schemes, but added about umbrella companies: \u201cThese kinds of arrangements are not compliant with tax and national insurance legislation and the end client or the employment businesses may be liable for any underpaid tax and national insurance.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cEmployers have a legal responsibility to operate PAYE and should be questioning very closely anyone offering quick-fix tax and national insurance arrangements. <\/p><p>\u201cWe are actively pursuing a growing number of investigations against these types of arrangements and have already successfully pursued a number of companies for tax, national insurance and interest where they were not playing by the rules.\u201d<\/p><p>Professional Passport, a consultancy that advises contractors and the recruitment industry on tax issues, said a lack of enforcement has encouraged the growth of offshore \u201cumbrella\u201d companies. Crawford Temple, managing director, estimated that HMRC lost \u00a330m-\u00a340m a year from offshore payroll abuses. He said Professional Passport had communicated its concerns to HMRC.<\/p><p>HMRC has faced problems accessing information on offshore umbrella schemes. It recently proposed tougher disclosure requirements, saying that, in one example, it had been unable to compel an offshore umbrella company to tell its workers that they were required to notify HMRC they were using a tax avoidance scheme.<\/p><p>In 2008, it also raised concerns about difficulties in recovering underpaid tax and national insurance contributions from umbrella companies, which had few assets and could wind up and move their workers to a new company.<\/p><p>HMRC said that when employers contracted with recruitment agencies, they paid a fee that included enough for the temporary worker to pay his or her national insurance contributions and a sum to enable the employer to pay its share of the national insurance. But offshore umbrella companies might pocket the money or share it with the recruitment firms that had contracted with it.<\/p><p>In August, HMRC issued a warning that it would challenge new tax avoidance schemes that seek to avoid income tax and national insurance contributions (NICs), which were being advertised to contractors, highly paid employees and those using recruitment agencies. It said: \u201cCurrent legislation ensures that rewards and recognition from working for UK-based businesses are charged appropriately to UK Income Tax and NICs.\u201d<\/p><p>In recent years, it has tightened up the law on \u201cdisguised remuneration\u201d and other schemes designed to avoid tax on employment income, including clawing back \u00a3100m retrospectively from users of an Isle of Man scheme. In 2008, it promised to step up its enforcement action against umbrella schemes that dodge tax and national insurance by claiming excessive travel expenses.<\/p>"},{"id":"33711861","uuid":"f11742fa-2501-11e2-8924-00144feabdc0","title":"Obama is the wiser bet for crisis-hit US","catid":"96","byline":"","datepublished":"Sun, 04 Nov 2012 18:41:46 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/f11742fa-2501-11e2-8924-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"Four years after the financial crisis, with inequality an affront to the American dream, there remains a need for intelligent, reformist governance","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Editorial"},"share":{"webappemail":"YqwPp9","webappshare":"PPIJbg"},"storypackage":[{"articleid":"33721551","title":"The Great Realignment"},{"articleid":"33721721","title":"US industrial commons"},{"articleid":"33722971","title":"US election \u2013 winning trades"},{"articleid":"33721521","title":"A Romney presidency would be just fine"}]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Sun, 04 Nov 2012 18:41:46 +0000","content":"<p>This year\u2019s US presidential election has been a dispiriting affair.<\/p><p>Compared with 2008, when Barack Obama emerged triumphant against all the early odds, the 2012 campaign has offered little inspiration, still less instruction, on what Mr Obama or his Republican rival Mitt Romney would actually do in office.<\/p><p>Yet Tuesday\u2019s election is arguably as important as any since 1980, when Ronald Reagan\u2019s victory accelerated a shift to deregulation and supply-side economics. Today, after the Great Crash of 2008, the US economy is recovering, albeit too slowly for many Americans out of work or in search of a decent-paying job. US pre-eminence is under threat in a world where advanced knowledge is widespread and low-cost labour readily available. In Afghanistan, the Middle East, north Africa and the South China Sea, America\u2019s resolve is being tested.<\/p><p>Neither candidate has provided convincing answers on how he would respond to these challenges. In a risk-averse campaign dominated by political consultants, both men have displayed a poverty of ambition. There have been few glimpses of a better future, of opportunities to be seized thanks to cheap natural gas and America\u2019s potential for energy self-sufficiency.<\/p><p>What is clear is that both men have a different philosophy of government. Mr Obama is an interventionist. He staked all on healthcare reform, bringing 30m Americans into a safety net. The president also pushed through a $787bn stimulus package that saved the country from another Great Depression. He poured billions into rescuing the Detroit car industry and secured several hundred thousand jobs. His other legacy is the Dodd-Frank act, the most sweeping reform of Wall Street since the 1930s, though one which has only been fitfully implemented.<\/p><p>Yet Mr Obama has often been curiously aloof. He has been notably cool toward business. The self-proclaimed agent of change has at crucial points failed to exercise leadership. He declined to endorse the Simpson-Bowles bipartisan panel\u2019s recommendations on cutting the ballooning federal deficit. The White House blames the implacable wall of opposition from Republicans in Congress. However, Mr Obama himself commissioned the report. The US now faces a \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d on January 1, which could trigger swingeing spending cuts and tax increases that could plunge the country back into recession.<\/p><p>On foreign affairs, Mr Obama has displayed caution after the misadventures of the Bush administration. He has withdrawn US forces from Iraq and drawn down troops in Afghanistan. He has pursued a relentless covert war against al-Qaeda terrorists and suspects. He boldly hunted down Osama bin Laden. He has been on the right side of the Arab uprisings. On Iran, perhaps the next administration\u2019s biggest foreign policy challenge, he has negotiated much tougher economic sanctions \u2013 without, however, slowing decisively the Tehran regime\u2019s plans to build a nuclear bomb.<\/p><p>Mr Romney\u2019s foreign policy proclamations have been far less reassuring. He has been needlessly belligerent. His advisers have a neocon hue. Yet the Obama campaign\u2019s attempts to cast Mr Romney as a billionaire predatory capitalist are surely wide of the mark. His Bain Capital experience and his term as governor of Massachusetts suggest a man comfortable with exercising executive power.<\/p><p>The more serious objection to Mr Romney is that he has gone through so many contortions to win his party\u2019s nomination that it is hard to see how he would govern in practice. His wishlist includes an aspiration to raise Pentagon spending by a fifth while cutting everyone\u2019s taxes and still somehow balancing the books. Such fiscal alchemy is an exercise in evasion, not a recipe for sustainable economic recovery.<\/p><p>Mr Romney\u2019s latest positioning as a pragmatic centrist appears to fit far better than his earlier incarnation as a rock-ribbed conservative Republican beholden to the Tea Party. The trouble is that it is impossible to be sure. His protean persona relies more on market research than any innate political philosophy.<\/p><p>As in his response to Hurricane Sandy, Mr Obama has shown that purposeful government can be part of the solution rather than the problem. Four years on from the financial crisis, with extreme inequality an affront to the American dream, there remains a need for intelligent, reformist governance. Mr Obama, his presidency defined by the economic crisis, looks the better choice.<\/p>"},{"id":"33711931","uuid":"22cc60be-2502-11e2-8924-00144feabdc0","title":"Restoring trust in the banking sector","catid":"96","byline":"","datepublished":"Sun, 04 Nov 2012 18:48:49 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/22cc60be-2502-11e2-8924-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"Cultural change must accompany strategic shrinkage if the system is to be run in the interests of shareholders, customers and the economy","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Editorial"},"share":{"webappemail":"PPOa9V","webappshare":"PPMWeV"},"stocks":{"ch:UBSN":"UBS AG","uk:BARC":"Barclays PLC"},"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Sun, 04 Nov 2012 18:48:49 +0000","content":"<p>Since the financial crisis, banks have talked a lot about the need to restore trust and prove their social usefulness. But the protestations of reform have often seemed pro forma, concealing a real desire to return as swiftly as possible to pre-crunch business as usual.<\/p><p>While acknowledging the need for stronger regulation, bosses have bridled at changing the way they manage institutions. They have persisted in chasing over-optimistic returns and paying sky-high salaries, arguing that to do otherwise would condemn their banks to also-ran status. The hard-sell investment banking culture has continued to predominate. <\/p><p>As 2012 has gone on, however, cracks have appeared in this position. These are partly the product of costly scandals that have tumbled out, which have in turn underlined the reputational and financial costs of the sales culture. <\/p><p>The revelation over the summer that banks had manipulated the Libor interest rate so outraged shareholders that in one case \u2013 that of Barclays \u2013 they ejected the top executive managers (both investment bankers).

Tightening regulation has started to unpick elements of the pre-crunch model. By forcing investment banks to run with less leverage and driving up the marginal cost of funding, the new rules are progressively driving some banks out of trading. Last week, UBS of Switzerland acknowledged the writing on the wall and announced plans to shut down parts of its investment bank, shedding 10,000 jobs. <\/p><p>These changes are welcome. While lucrative for practitioners, the pre-crunch banking model brought precious few social benefits. Little if any value was created for investors.

More still needs to be done if the system is to be run in the interests of shareholders, customers and the economy rather than bankers themselves. <\/p><p>Managements must be more realistic about the returns that banks can achieve, and more responsive to efforts to cut gearing and raise capital over time. Bonuses and pay should be more modest. The service culture must be restored in high street banking. These are not things that can be fixed by a few rule-tweaks, or by bolstering the capital that banks are required to hold. They require a real change of heart and expectation. If this cannot be achieved by the current leadership, a new generation will have to be sent for.

Last week I asked how it could be, that somebody who was pessimistic about the eurozone six months ago could be optimistic today? If you always thought it was just a liquidity crisis, you should not have been worried then, and you would be right to be optimistic now. If you thought of it as a solvency crisis, as I did, you should still be worried now.<\/p><p>Several readers pointed out to me, quite rightly, that I offered only an extreme choice. What about a solvency crisis that is not inherent but caused by a liquidity squeeze \u2013 a self-perpetuating insolvency crisis? Solvency is, after all, an analytic concept. It depends on the level of debt, future growth, ability to tap private sector wealth through taxation, ability to raise funds through privatisation and, of course, future market interest rates. Reasonable people could disagree on all of these. Even Germany could be considered insolvent if you assumed a sufficiently high interest rate.<\/p><p>Distinguishing pure sovereign risk (minus the contingent liabilities for the financial and non-financial private sectors) from risks that have arisen purely in those sectors, my judgment on the solvency of various entities in the eurozone has been the following. In the first category, I consider Greece to be unconditionally insolvent; Italy and Portugal to be solvent \u2013 but conditional upon a return to sustained growth. I consider the sovereigns of Spain, Ireland and the rest to be fundamentally solvent \u2013 minus the banks, of course. In the second category, I consider the private and financial sectors in Spain, Portugal and Ireland to be insolvent.<\/p><p>Once you conflate sovereign and financial sector risk, the situation becomes more complicated. My bottom line is that the national backstops have not removed, and have possibly increased, the total solvency risk in the system. <\/p><p>Even worse, I believe the outlook for solvency has deteriorated over the past six months due to the effects of austerity on growth at a time when interest rates have hit their lower limit. The economists Dawn Holland and Jonathan Portes have pointed out one other reason why the fiscal multiplier is unusually high at the moment: everyone is pursuing austerity at the same time. We may well have crossed the line where austerity not only raised debt ratios in the short run, which is to be expected, but may end up increasing them even in the long run \u2013 so that it becomes self-defeating.<\/p><p>So if you started from where I did, you cannot be optimistic. But then again, as an Irish saying goes, you might not start from here.<\/p><p>John McHale, economics professor at the National University of Ireland, Galway, has argued that official policy can restore financial health in a self-perpetuating solvency crisis, provided a number of conditions are met. He lists four. First, the liquidity support given through the European Central Bank\u2019s Outright Monetary Transactions programme and other mechanisms must be reliable. Second, the conditions must be reasonable. Third, the conditionality must be flexible \u2013 unanticipated shocks should not trigger fiscal adjustments in future. Fourth, the link between banking sector losses and state debt must be broken.<\/p><p>I concede that these conditions, especially the fourth, could restore solvency everywhere except in Greece. The problem is that they stand in contrast to official policy. The ECB has only announced the OMT programme. So far, nobody has made an application. The Spanish prime minister is still playing hard to get and I doubt he will make an application this year. The OMT may end up as a phantom. As in Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s fairy tale \u2013 I am writing this column from Denmark \u2013 it may not be very long until some child in the bond markets points out that Mario Draghi has no clothes.<\/p><p>Second, it has been, and continues to be, official policy that countries must heap one austerity programme on top of another if they miss nominal deficit targets \u2013 which they do because they keep underestimating the fiscal multiplier. Finally, even though I assume that eurozone leaders want to set up a meaningful banking union, I see no chance that this will lead to a separation of banking and sovereign risks. Angela Merkel stated clearly that this was not going to happen. <\/p><p>The main significance of the OMT, should it ever become a reality, would be to prevent a contagious spiral between bank debt and sovereign debt for approximately two to three years. This would be important in its own right, but does not in itself improve the underlying solvency of the various entities, given current policy choices.<\/p><p>You have to make some brave assumptions about the future \u2013 continued rollover, separation of banking and sovereign risks, readiness for fiscal transfers, readiness to abandon austerity \u2013 all of which stand in complete contrast to officially announced policies. Solvency thus depends on the assumption that official policy is a lie. One could make that assumption, of course. I have not, and would not.<\/p><p><a onclick=\"if (mFT.mailto) return mFT.mailto('munchau@eurointelligence.com')\" href=\"mailto:munchau@eurointelligence.com\">munchau@eurointelligence.com<\/a><\/p>"},{"id":"33711971","uuid":"12d7ac24-2433-11e2-94d0-00144feabdc0","title":"There is no place for French-style protectionism in UK","catid":"171","byline":"By Geoff\u2009Owen","datepublished":"Sun, 04 Nov 2012 19:11:18 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/12d7ac24-2433-11e2-94d0-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"The Heseltine review contains no evidence that France\u2019s approach to takeovers has been good for the French economy, writes Geoff Owen","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Opinion"},"share":{"webappemail":"PPOcyO","webappshare":"RI1RTk"},"stocks":{"jp:5202":"Nippon Sheet Glass Co Ltd","fr:BN":"Danone SA"},"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Sun, 04 Nov 2012 19:11:18 +0000","content":"<p>Should we put our faith in markets or does the gentleman in Whitehall (or Westminster) know best? Lord Heseltine argues in his review of industrial policy that the government, instead of watching passively when British companies are acquired by foreigners, should be prepared to override the market and block takeovers that threaten vital national interests.<\/p><p>While he accepts that in general the country\u2019s open stance towards inward investment has been beneficial, he thinks that \u201cgovernment needs to have a better sense of how certain types of foreign acquisition might affect our strategic national capabilities\u201d. He wants civil servants to identify strategically important takeovers, and \u201cto engage assertively and knowledgeably with foreign investors to secure the commitments that will strengthen our industrial base\u201d. In exceptional cases the government should use its powers under the 2002 Enterprise Act to bar takeovers that are likely to cause damage.<\/p><p>There are echoes here of the remarks made by John Kay in his report on short-termism. He too thinks that when the government is uneasy about a proposed takeover \u2013 for example, where the acquirer seems likely to run the business less well or because the transaction might lead to the loss of high-level jobs \u2013 it should express its anxiety openly and forcefully.<\/p><p>All this harks back to the 1960s and 1970s, when the Monopolies Commission could rule against proposed mergers on the basis of rather ill-defined public interest considerations. The result was confusion and uncertainty, with ample scope for lobbying.<\/p><p>Thanks to a series of reforms that began with the Tebbit guidelines in 1984, merger policy has now been made clearer and more predictable, and largely depoliticised. While the government can intervene where national security is involved, there is little scope for takeovers to be prohibited unless they pose a threat to competition.<\/p><p>The other big change in the 1980s was an end to the policy of protecting national champions. In the 1960s the Labour government thwarted a Swedish takeover of the leading British ball bearings manufacturer because that industry was thought to be too important to be owned by foreigners. Then came the Thatcher revolution and a very different approach to ownership. The ball bearings group that had been created to fend off the Swedes was sold in 1990 to NSK of Japan.<\/p><p>Lord Heseltine wants the state to be less \u201cdisengaged\u201d on foreign takeovers and more like other countries that, he says, have powers to protect their national interests. He cites the case of France, which assesses foreign acquisitions on the basis of broader criteria, including their impact on the international competitiveness of French industry.<\/p><p>The Heseltine review contains no evidence that France\u2019s restrictive approach to foreign takeovers has been good for the French economy. What is clear is that his proposal would inject an element of political discretion into mergers policy that is bound to deter foreign investors.<\/p><p>Ministers and officials would first have to decide whether the industry concerned is strategic, and this is a very elastic term. (In 2005, in what became known as the strategic yoghurt policy, the French authorities made it clear that Danone, the food products group, was off limits for foreign acquirers.) They would then have to consider what the consequences of the takeover would be. This is a notoriously difficult exercise and there is no reason to suppose that civil servants will be better at it than boards of directors or shareholders.<\/p><p>Take the acquisition of Pilkington, the glassmaker, by Nippon Sheet Glass of Japan in 2006. Is glass a strategic industry?

However, rules and regulations to implement the bill will take another 90 days from Friday, they added.<\/p><p>The bill underwent more than 100 changes throughout the year amid heated debate involving parliament, the president\u2019s office and local business.<\/p><p>The final bill contained 10 key changes proposed by Mr Thein Sein, including an unexpected provision that removed the caps on foreign ownership of joint ventures. Under the new law, joint-venture partners will be able to determine the ratio of ownership between themselves.<\/p><p>However, parliament rejected a change designed to enable business to pay more to skilled foreign workers.<\/p><p>The president\u2019s proposed changes largely answered complaints by pro-business reformers that the bill was too protectionist and would deter foreign investors. Among final amendments, a proposed minimum investment of $5m, for example, was removed.<\/p><p>The new law has also boosted the discretionary powers of the Myanmar Investment Commission, giving it the ability to determine foreign investment levels in so-called \u201crestricted\u201d or sensitive sectors.<\/p><p>The previous draft law featured limits of as low as 35 per cent for foreign involvement in sectors as sweeping as \u201cfisheries\u201d and \u201cagriculture\u201d.

Ms Nair warned, however, that foreign business was likely to remain cautious as \u201cmany other factors\u201d must be addressed \u2013 including regulatory frameworks and judicial reforms.<\/p><p>Investors have also gained confidence from a decision by the World Bank last week to approve the resumption of aid after a 25-year hiatus. The World Bank earmarked $245m in funds for Myanmar as an initial move \u2013 $80m of it in grants for community development and the remainder to be disbursed after the country clears nearly $900m of arrears owed to the bank and the Asian Development Bank.<\/p><p>Separately, European Commission chief Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso on a weekend visit to Myanmar told Mr Thein Sein that the EU was ready to provide more than $100m in development aid to Myanmar.<\/p><p>Mr Barroso visited Myanmar at the same time as the Danish and Norwegian prime ministers. The country will host the Swedish prime minister on November 12 and, in late November, Barack Obama, the US president.

It has produced two businesses \u2013 search software company Autonomy and chip designer Arm Holdings \u2013 that each attained market capitalisations of more than $10bn, and 11 companies worth more than $1bn.<\/p><p>As the market for public flotation has dried up and venture capital funding has slowed, the individuals behind these companies, including figures such as Mike Lynch, founder and ex-chief executive of Autonomy, are stepping into the breach, providing not only seed funding but larger sums for companies seeking a new phase of expansion. <\/p><p>\u201cSome of these people have tremendous firepower \u2013 more than the VCs in some cases,\u201d said Andy Hopper, head of the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory and a veteran technology entrepreneur.<\/p><p>Professor Hopper, who has himself set up 12 companies, three of which have gone public, describes a super-angel as someone who might invest \u00a31m or more. \u201cThey make some money here and they recycle it,\u201d he says. <\/p><p>One company that has benefited from Mr Lynch\u2019s investing power is Featurespace, which uses complex behavioural algorithms to detect early signs of fraud or predict when customers are liable to switch to a rival provider. <\/p><p>Founded in 2005 by David Excell, an Australian computing PhD student, and his academic supervisor Professor Bill Fitzgerald, the company now has 16 staff and \u00a32.5m in funding. <\/p><p>Cambridge Enterprise, the university body which helps academics commercialise their work, has given a leg-up to 101 companies since 1995 \u2013 businesses that have gone on to raise \u00a31bn in follow-up funding. Recent successes include BlueGnome, a biotech company acquired in September by Illumina of the US for an undisclosed sum.<\/p><p>Anne Dobr\u00e9e, head of seed funds at Cambridge Enterprise, agreed that angels had surged into the gap left by retreating VCs, but cautioned that the substitution was not complete. Life sciences companies in particular faced tougher times, because of the high costs of taking a product beyond the start-up phase in the sector. \u201cYou may need \u00a330m or more to get to market,\u201d she said. <\/p><p>Cambridge Enterprise, which has a \u00a315m fund through which it invests in start-ups, encourages deeper links with international investors through its venture partners group, whose 18 members include investors such as Arch, Wellington Partners and BASF Venture Capital. <\/p><p>It is also boosting its own funding capability through a \u00a31m fund for seed investments \u2013 set up under the government\u2019s Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme \u2013 and another, longer-term plan for a \u00a350m institutional fund. \u201cThis will provide follow-on funding for the cream of our crop,\u201d said Ms Dobr\u00e9e.<\/p><p>One blot on Cambridge\u2019s reputation as a business centre is road congestion. The A14, thronged with freight from Felixstowe, is a particular bugbear, and the medieval origins of its infrastructure are betrayed by the lines of traffic frequently snaking through the city. <\/p><p>Rail services are a better story. An improved 45-minute direct service to London has helped break down the mental distance between the cities, and improved relationships with the capital\u2019s investors and entrepreneurs. <\/p><p>Old hands in Cambridge, with its record of successful businesses going back to Acorn and Sinclair Research in the 1980s, see the software, design and media businesses that have flourished in the old industrial quarters of east London, receiving the imprimatur of government as Tech City, as complementary to their activities rather than rivals to them. <\/p><p>David Cleevely, chairman and co-founder of the Cambridge Angels network, remains evangelical about the smaller city\u2019s ability to generate wealth. <\/p><p>\u201cTake something like \u00a330bn of market capitalisation and divide it by 100,000 people ...

Other business schools, including Harvard and Columbia, have teamed up with their university\u2019s respective public affairs schools \u2013 Harvard Kennedy School of Government and Columbia\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs \u2013 to offer joint degrees.<\/p><p>Bringing the significance of public policy to the attention of MBA students is a growing concern for many business schools, which are enhancing public policy elements in their curricula.<\/p><p>\u201cFor most MBA [students] this is the last formal education they will receive,\u201d says Matthew Slaughter, associate dean of the Tuck School. \u201cTo be internationally capable, today\u2019s MBA graduates must understand the goals and mechanisms of government decision makers.\u201d<\/p><p>This summer Tuck launched the Center for Global Business and Government, headed by Prof Slaughter, to prepare future business leaders with an understanding of the complex interactions between companies and governments.<\/p><p>Marianne Bertrand, professor of economics at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business, believes it is essential that MBA students have a greater awareness of debates concerning market failure, regulation and lobbying.<\/p><p>\u201cStudents arrive in my class with black-and-white views,\u201d she says. While she accepts that these issues may not be directly applied in graduates\u2019 careers, she says that a sophisticated understanding of government\u2019s relevance is critical for students to engage successfully with government policies that affect their companies.<\/p><p>Prof Mayo believes business schools will have underachieved if they do not expose students to perspectives from outside the insular world of business. Georgetown\u2019s Center for Business and Public Policy, established in 2002, comprises 20 senior academics from Georgetown and beyond. It engages McDonough students through a series of seminars involving the business and policy communities, on economic policy issues that affect business.<\/p><p>Part of the centre\u2019s \u201cevolution of regulation\u201d series involves senior federal regulators coming to the school to discuss their work and its impact. With the university\u2019s law and public policy schools, a certificate is planned for those McDonough students who take part in these seminars.<\/p><p>Some students, such as Richard Caperton, an MBA alumnus of 2009, join the centre in a research capacity during their MBA programme. Mr Caperton, who today works for the Center for American Progress, an influential Washington-based think-tank, is one of a small number of Georgetown MBA students who were looking to continue in the public policy realm after graduation.<\/p><p>\u201cWhile there is an element of self-selection among Georgetown students \u2013 who tend to be more policy-oriented than most business students \u2013 they are still coming for a business education\u201d, says Prof Mayo.<\/p><p>Prof Slaughter cites the lack of structured relationships between business schools and government agencies as a limitation on MBA students gaining public policy experience during their degree. \u201cThe reality is that key US agencies have no experience with hosting MBAs [for internships].\u201d<\/p><p>These challenges contrast with the well-trodden path to Capitol Hill taken by several leading business-school academics. Laura Tyson, professor and former dean of the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Haas School and Glenn Hubbard, dean of Columbia Business School, both served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W.

Critical thinking, admissions of failure and expressions of doubt have been actively discouraged in favour of high levels of risk-taking and excessively positive thinking. Business schools and other development providers have been culpable of being part of this trend towards what I describe as \u201cProzac leadership\u201d, where leaders, managers and society as a whole are addicted to an excessive and artificial positivity.<\/p><p>Believing their own words that everything is going well, Prozac leaders discourage open debate and criticism. Unwilling to listen to alternative views, they misunderstand or miss problems entirely, leaving their organisations ill-prepared to deal with unforeseen events and setbacks.<\/p><p>At the same time by insisting that subordinates\u2019 upward communication is exclusively positive, this type of leadership can end up silencing committed employees and punishing those who dissent.<\/p><p>A recurrent theme which has frequently emerged in my own research in UK organisations is that employees often detect inconsistencies between leaders\u2019 excessively positive messages and their practices. Research on two North Sea oil installations, for example, found that despite senior management\u2019s upbeat claims about the company\u2019s safety performance, many offshore workers did not disclose accidents and near misses. Believing that managers would prefer not to hear about any difficulties related to safety, workers deliberately communicated overly positive messages back up the hierarchy.<\/p><p>In many western societies, positive thinking is now a multimillion-pound industry. Although positive thinking cultures at work encourage optimism, celebrate success and express high expectations, they can lead to false promises, disciplinary pressures and blame. For example, proponents of positive thinking presuppose that if your business fails, or your job is eliminated, it must be your fault \u2013 if an optimistic outlook is the key to economic success, then there is no excuse for failure.<\/p><p>In contemporary research in business schools, positive thinking is strongly encouraged by the focus on appreciative inquiry, positive psychology and positive organisational behaviour; themes that are influential especially in the US and increasingly in the UK, Europe and the far east.<\/p><p>The international impact of excessive positivity in scholarly work can also be seen in the hostile reaction of some US scholars to articles which apply a critical analysis to leadership and management. The preference of anonymous reviewers in the US for uncritical studies in many of the dominant US business school journals constitutes a key publication barrier for more critical scholarship.<\/p><p>European schools have the potential to challenge these dominant dynamics and to demonstrate the necessity of critical and independent thinking in their teaching and research \u2013 and how this translates into hands-on business leadership which is clear-sighted, willing to confront difficult realities and unafraid to speak in terms of problems when necessary. Research consistently demonstrates that honesty is a key attribute that followers value in leaders.<\/p><p>Being positive can indeed be empowering and transformational, facilitating innovation and enhancing teamwork and in many cases is of course, preferable to its opposite. But positivity is now so embedded, ubiquitous and taken for granted in popular western cultures that it is rarely questioned. The unfounded optimism of Prozac leadership can damage performance by eroding trust, communication, learning and preparedness \u2013 either silencing followers or provoking more overt resistance. More effective leadership dynamics are likely to emerge when optimism is combined with critical thinking, when positivity is tempered with a willingness to confront difficult realities and when an upbeat vision is blended with a capacity to listen to alternative voices.<\/p><p>Professor David Collinson, Lancaster University Management School<\/p>"},{"id":"33716281","uuid":"327048e8-0967-11e2-a5a9-00144feabdc0","title":"Lessons from management\u2019s wild west","catid":"74","byline":"By Ian Wylie","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 00:00:19 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/2\/327048e8-0967-11e2-a5a9-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"An elective on running for office aims to demystify the world of politics and help to create better leaders, writes Ian Wylie","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Business Education"},"share":{"webappemail":"PQdNYo","webappshare":"PQcKaJ"},"image":true,"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 00:00:19 +0000","content":"<p>The US presidential election has heightened interest in Steve Jarding\u2019s Running for Office and Managing Campaigns course at Harvard Kennedy School of Government, which is taken by Harvard Business School students on the joint MBA\/masters in public policy.<\/p><p>Mr Jarding, who has run a similar elective for Iese MBA students in Madrid for the past four years, has managed and worked on campaigns for Democratic party senate and presidential candidates including Bob Kerrey, Mark Warner, John Edwards and Jim Webb \u2013 and was described by the New York Times as a \u201csmart and aggressive tactician\u201d who wins races in places he is not supposed to.<\/p><p>Why do business students want to study campaign management?<\/p><p>Because it matters. Public service is important and as crazy as politics can be, it\u2019s the vehicle that drives you to the place you can govern.<\/p><p>Campaign management can be the Wild West of management and it\u2019s a pretty ugly profession: 18-hour days, seven days a week. But it\u2019s how you make a difference. I believe I had a significant role in helping Jim Webb win in 2006 the seat that swung the Senate to Democrats. That sounds arrogant but you have to believe you can make a difference.<\/p><p>You may not like the political system but candidates don\u2019t govern. I tell students it\u2019s akin to two islands: the candidate island and the elected official island. Unfortunately, the water between those islands is more like a cesspool and you have to jump in if you want to govern. But hopefully I instil in my students the importance of values, so when they swim through that dirty water they don\u2019t forget who they are. My role is to show students a path to victory and let them decide on the variables.<\/p><p>Do students want to run for office?<\/p><p>Yes, even those from the MBA track. Some students disenfranchise themselves, thinking they have to be wealthy or that they don\u2019t know enough policy. So we try to demystify some of it. For example, you need to know only a little about everything. If you\u2019re not a good speaker, we can teach you communication. If you have skeletons in the closet \u2013 we can show you how to address those.<\/p><p>How is the course structured?<\/p><p>We first ask what does public service mean to you? And why would you run? Then we examine how to know your district and not just the stats. You need to know voters\u2019 fears and insecurities. You need to find what families in your district are talking about at their kitchen tables. If you can tap into those, you are more likely to sell your product, your candidacy, to them.<\/p><p>Then we launch into setting up a campaign plan \u2013 how do you raise money, how do you do opposition research, what consultants do you hire, what\u2019s your policy position, how do you set up a policy team \u2013 before looking at get-out-the-vote techniques.<\/p><p>Any successful alumni?<\/p><p>I have a student who was elected to represent Delaware, two just elected to parliament in Switzerland and one who helped implement the winning campaign plan for Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy in Spain. I have another in Asia who plans to run for prime minister and I believe he will win, as he was a terrific student.<\/p><p>I\u2019m the biggest cynic in the world about politics until I get into class and teach these students. Then I realise we\u2019re going to be fine. If this course can create better leaders for the US and around the world, we\u2019ll have a better world.<\/p><p>Why don\u2019t other business schools offer campaigning courses?<\/p><p>I think some schools believe their students only want to go out and make money. However, you don\u2019t have to devote your whole career to politics. You can work in politics for 10 years and then go back into business. My experience of business school students is that while they want to make money, they also understand their role in the world and that business and government depend on each other. If business schools could demystify the world of politics, why wouldn\u2019t we want our best students to consider political careers?<\/p>"},{"id":"33717431","uuid":"90c8e6d0-2694-11e2-9109-00144feabdc0","title":"Investcorp to buy Georg Jensen for $140m","catid":"94","byline":"By Simeon Kerr in Dubai","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 01:28:20 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/90c8e6d0-2694-11e2-9109-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"Middle Eastern investment house is buying business, founded by the Danish designer in 1904 from private equity firm Axcel Capital Partners","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Luxury 360"},"share":{"webappemail":"TtfAPJ","webappshare":"RA7qGU"},"stocks":{"bh:INVCORP":"Investcorp Bank BSC"},"image":true,"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 01:28:20 +0000","content":"<p>Investcorp is set on Monday to unveil the $140m acquisition of Georg Jensen as the Bahrain-based group seeks to turn the Danish luxury retailer into a global name through expansion in Asia.<\/p><p>As part of the deal, luxury entrepreneur David Chu will become chief creative officer and co-chairman of Georg Jensen\u2019s board.

S&P and ABN\u2019s wholesale banking arm, which is now owned by RBS, also published information and statements that were either \u201cfalse\u201d or involved \u201cnegligent misrepresentations\u201d, Justice Jayne Jagot found.<\/p><p>The 1,500-page ruling marks the first time a rating agency has stood a full trial over a structured finance product. <\/p><p>The Australian ruling led some investors to reassess their previously sanguine view of the legal landscape for the rating agencies. In New York trading, S&P\u2019s parent McGraw-Hill closed 4 per cent weaker, versus a broadly flat equity market. Moody\u2019s fell 3 per cent.<\/p><p>\u201cThis is a major blow to the rating agencies, which for years have had the benefit of profiting from the assignment of these ratings without ever being accountable to investors for those opinions,\u201d said Amanda Banton, the lawyer representing the councils. <\/p><p>\u201cNo longer will rating agencies be able to hide behind disclaimers to absolve themselves from liability.\u201d <\/p><p>John Walker, executive director of IMF Australia, the listed litigation company that funded the action by the local authorities, said the Australian ruling was likely to pave the way for \u201csignificant recoveries\u201d in Europe.<\/p><p>Nevertheless following Monday\u2019s ruling, lawyers outside of Australia were sceptical about how easy it would be to pursue similar claims in the US or Europe. <\/p><p>In the US and other jurisdictions, rating agencies have been largely successful in batting away dozens of legal cases claiming that they should be held liable for inaccurate ratings on derivatives and other securities that fell in value during the financial crisis. The agencies have successfully argued that their ratings are just opinions, protected by the US Constitution\u2019s free speech guarantee and by disclaimers in their published reports.<\/p><p>In one important outstanding case, however, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and a group of other investors have been granted a trial to decide claims that Moody\u2019s and S&P were party to a fraud because they did not believe their ratings on a structured investment vehicle marketed by Morgan Stanley.<\/p><p>The councils in New South Wales were assured the CPDOs purchased in late 2006 from Local Government Financial Services, a municipal adviser, had only a small chance of defaulting. But less than two years later the securities, which were linked to credit default swaps on investment grade companies, were liquidated as spreads rose and the cash backing the notes fell to dangerously low levels.<\/p><p>The councils lost more than 90 per cent of the A$17m they invested in the securities, also known as the \u201cRembrandt\u201d notes. A 13th council, which sued separately, lost almost A$1m.<\/p><p>Following Monday\u2019s ruling, the councils stand to receive A$16m in damages but the total cost of the case including legal fees and interest could reach A$30m, according to Mr Walker.<\/p><p>LGFS, which counter sued ABN Amro and S&P, has been told that it is also entitled to compensation for the A$16m loss it incurred on the sale of the notes to its parent company. LGFS purchased A$45m of the securities from ABN Amro, reselling A$18.5m to the councils and keeping the rest.<\/p><p>S&P, a division of publishing company McGraw-Hill, said it planned to appeal. \u201cWe are disappointed with the court\u2019s decision, we reject any suggestion our opinions were inappropriate and we will appeal the Australian ruling, which relates to a specific CPDO rating,\u201d S&P said in a statement. RBS said in a statement it was \u201cstudying this long and complex judgment\u201d.<\/p><p>During the trial S&P argued that the councils had not done any work to try and understand the investments, relying on advice from LGFS.

The reality is that the victor will not have the power to change the nation\u2019s economic direction, at least in the short run.<\/p><p>There are two reasons for that \u2013 the structure of US government, and America\u2019s changing place in the world.<\/p><p>The important thing to remember is that the US president has far less power over the economy than is commonly believed \u2013 and not nearly as much as the British prime minister, for example. The reason is simple: the constitution expressly limits the president\u2019s power and the institutions of government that have developed since 1789 limit it further.<\/p><p>Unlike prime ministers, who necessarily have working majorities in parliament, US presidents must frequently deal with congresses under control of the other party. Different parties may also control the House and Senate, as is the case now with Republicans controlling the former and Democrats the latter.<\/p><p>In all likelihood the current political split in Congress will not change after the election. But even if Republicans gain control of the Senate, it will be by the skin of their teeth, while a 50-50 split is quite possible. A thin majority or split senate will likely mean more paralysis given that only 40 votes are needed to block almost any presidential initiative, since 60 are necessary to break a filibuster (the practice of senators extemporising at length to prevent a vote).<\/p><p>Moreover, even under the best of circumstances, in which a president controls the House and has 60 votes in the Senate, changing policy is very difficult, as we saw when President Obama enjoyed this advantage during the early days of his administration. That is because members of Congress are provincial and myopic, subject to very little in the way of party discipline, and have different institutional perspectives even when they share the president\u2019s political philosophy.<\/p><p>Furthermore, US presidents have far less control of the government\u2019s operations than most people realise. They can appoint only a few thousand staff. Ethical constraints and financial disclosure requirements discourage many of the best people from serving in government. Without political leadership, cabinet departments are run by career bureaucrats, who tend to maintain the status quo. Many important government functions are now performed by independent agencies such as the Federal Reserve Board or Securities and Exchange Commission. Those agencies\u2019 leaders serve fixed terms, which often outlast the president\u2019s, by 10 years in the case of members of the Federal Reserve Board for example.<\/p><p>Indeed<a onclick=\"mFT.router.loadArticle(32623371, null, null, null, true); return false;\" title=\"A full Fed board can fire up the US economy\" href=\"http:\/\/blogs.ft.com\/the-a-list\/2012\/06\/27\/a-full-fed-board-can-fire-up-the-us-economy\/\" target=\"_blank\"> changes at the central bank<\/a> are likely to have far more influence on the economy than the presidential election. With politicians unable to hammer out an agreement on fiscal policy, it has been left to Ben Bernanke and his Federal Reserve colleagues to pilot the economy through monetary policy alone. That means the next president\u2019s most meaningful economic decision may well be nominating a new chair of the Federal Reserve, should Mr Bernanke not seek a third term in the post.<\/p><p>Finally over the years the Supreme Court has become deeply involved in economic policy questions, for example only allowing Obama\u2019s signature health reform to stand by a hair\u2019s breadth. Over the years Republicans have been far more aggressive in appointing federal judges, who serve for life, that are not shy about using the courts to implement their ideology. In the past, the same was true of Democrats, but both Obama and Bill Clinton have tended to appoint nonideological judges who do not provide a counterweight to those appointed by George W. Bush.<\/p><p>All this means that America\u2019s basic economic policy is unlikely to change much or quickly whoever wins the presidency. What really matters for the economy is the economy itself \u2013 the actions of workers, business people, entrepreneurs, investors and so on, who go about their jobs largely oblivious to what comes out of Washington.<\/p><p>That is unlikely to change materially for some time, even were presidential authority unlimited. The economy is like an ocean liner that changes direction only very slowly, although a small change is meaningful if sustained long enough.<\/p><p>The fact is that the underlying trend rate of growth of the US economy is a function of two things politicians can\u2019t do much about: productivity and demography.<\/p><p>The formula for long-term growth is basically labour force growth plus the growth in productivity or output per worker. America&#8217;s demography is a low birth rate and falling immigration, which prevents the population and labour force from rising. As population growth falls, so, necessarily, will growth.<\/p><p>So far, productivity has held up, but in the long run it is dependent on research and development and a continuing new supply of ideas and technological innovation. Government policy affects such things only slowly and indirectly, and the payoff may not come for decades.<\/p><p>Finally presidents can do very little about the business cycle \u2013 the quarterly ups and downs in the economy around the long-term trend.<\/p><p>In short, much of the economy\u2019s trend is baked in the cake, and there is not much presidents can do to change it. To the extent they can exert influence there are institutional and political obstacles to doing so. The reality is that whoever wins, the economy will be pretty much the same for the foreseeable future.<\/p><p><em>The writer is a former senior economist at the White House, US Congress and Treasury.

By contrast, Nissan, its largest Japanese rival, makes one-quarter of its sales in China.<\/p><p>Japanese carmakers have been hurt by a consumer backlash against Japanese products in China that gathered force in September amid a political dispute over a group of islands in the East China Sea. The uninhabited islands, called the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, are controlled by Tokyo but claimed by Beijing.<\/p><p>Last week Honda, Japan\u2019s third-largest carmaker by sales, cited a drop in sales in China as it cut its full-year forecast by 20 per cent. Nissan, which reports earnings on Tuesday, is likely to miss its current sales and profit targets as well, Carlos Ghosn, chief executive, suggested in an interview with the Financial Times last week.<\/p><p>Toyota\u2019s sales in China plunged 49 per cent in September and were down by nearly the same amount in October. Although the decline was not enough to prompt Toyota to downgrade its profit forecast, the company did reduce its consolidated sales volume estimate by 50,000 vehicles, to 8.75m.<\/p><p>It cited \u201cuncertainties in the Chinese and European market environments\u201d for the cut but said it intended to make up the earnings difference through cost savings.<\/p><p>In Europe, Toyota reported an operating profit of Y8.6bn, 54 per cent higher than a year ago, making it one of the few mass market carmakers that is not losing money this year in Europe. <\/p><p>\u201cWe decreased our cost structure, but increased our revenue,\u201d Didier Leroy, president of Toyota\u2019s European business, said in an interview. \u201cWe will continue to make sure that we can have a break-even point that\u2019s much lower.\u201d <\/p><p>Toyota has managed to stay profitable despite an industry-wide crisis in the region by cutting costs, including an 800-person headcount reduction in its Brussels head office, and using its European plants more efficiently, Mr Leroy said. He said the carmaker was \u201cfully and strongly confident\u201d that it would be profitable for the full year. <\/p><p>Toyota\u2019s upward revision to its profit outlook may partly reflect its traditionally conservative approach to forecasting. Toyota has earned 70 per cent of its upgraded forecast in the first half and analysts\u2019 full-year projections had been more bullish than the company\u2019s. The imbalance implies either that the company expects a significant slowdown in the second half or more revisions are to come.<\/p><p>In the July-September quarter, Toyota earned a net profit of Y257.9bn, a more than threefold increase from the same period a year ago when it was still struggling with the aftermath of the Japanese earthquake. The disaster scrambled its supply chains and caused its factories to stop or curtail production for months.<\/p><p>Toyota\u2019s operating profit in North America tripled to Y45.9bn, while profit in Europe rose 54 per cent to Y8.6bn. Its Japanese operations moved from a Y69.3bn loss to a Y143.7bn gain.<\/p><p>Additional reporting by John Reed in London <\/p>"},{"id":"33720611","uuid":"ce52b3ec-270b-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0","title":"Rio Tinto\u2019s Mongolia mine clears hurdle","catid":"43","byline":"By Leslie Hook in Tianjin","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 13:33:46 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/ce52b3ec-270b-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"Group\u2019s $5bn flagship Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold site is set to start producing after finally sealing a deal with China for power supply","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Mining"},"share":{"webappemail":"Ss9heq","webappshare":"RAt4L7"},"stocks":{"ca:TRQ":"Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd","uk:RIO":"Rio Tinto PLC"},"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 13:33:46 +0000","content":"<p>Oyu Tolgoi, Rio Tinto\u2019s flagship Mongolian copper-gold mine, is set to begin production in less than three months after finally resolving the issue of power supply from  neighbouring China that had caused delays to the nearly $6bn project.<\/p><p>The start of production will be a major landmark for Mongolia.

These distractions might help explain many investors\u2019 underperformance during the past year. Rhetoric suggesting the US \u201ccould be the next Greece\u201d seems quite exaggerated because the US is already experiencing a historic deleveraging, and is one of the few economies that is actually improving. <\/p><p>The melodrama certainly contributed to investors\u2019 underweight of the US within global equity portfolios, and that one decision caused performance to suffer. For the 12-month period ending September 30, the S&P 500\u2019s total return was slightly above 30 per cent, whereas the MSCI World Index excluding the US returned roughly half that. <\/p><p>Politicians rarely cite government debt as a percentage of gross domestic product, but this ratio is critical to investors. A larger corporation is likely to have a larger value of assets and liabilities (such as debt) on their balance sheet than might a smaller company. However, it is a company\u2019s debt\/equity ratio that lends insight regarding the risk of the company. A larger economy is similarly more likely to have a larger total value of outstanding debt, but debt\/GDP ratios offer much more insight when gauging country risk. <\/p><p>The famous \u201cdebt clocks\u201d scattered throughout the US, which show the real-time expansion of government debt are quite misleading. The seemingly rapid expansion of government debt, highlighted by the debt clocks\u2019 second-by-second increases, looks horrifying, but it is important to remember that GDP expands real-time as well. A debt\/GDP clock might be quite boring though, and wouldn\u2019t attract much attention.<\/p><p>A country\u2019s total debt, and not simply its government debt, helps determine the value of its currency and its future standard of living, yet political discussion focuses solely on government debt. Certainly, an expansion of government debt should always be carefully watched, but the current rhetoric regarding the growth in government debt totally ignores the significant deleveraging within the remainder of the US economy. <\/p><p>According to data compiled by Bloomberg, total US debt (ie, the combination of government, corporate, and household debt) as a percentage of GDP peaked in 2008 at 359 per cent. The current figure is about 329 per cent. Although the absolute percentage remains high by historical standards, this decrease is unprecedented since 1970.<\/p><p>It is widely accepted that the US is entering a secular period of deleveraging, and the data so far support that notion. However, politicians ignore that the deleveraging of the US private sector is actually overwhelming the added leverage within the public sector.<\/p><p>Some politicians criticise the Fed\u2019s monetary policies. I have thought for more than a decade that the Fed\u2019s policies, under both Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke, have shown a lack of understanding of global financial markets. Financial theory outlines that there is a point at which lower hurdle rates cause imprudent risk-taking, but the Fed\u2019s policies to foster lower rates reflect an apparent belief that risk-taking is desirable regardless of whether marginal investment is benefiting the real economy. Extreme financial inflation can be as detrimental as extreme price inflation.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, political criticisms of the Fed\u2019s policies often mislead investors. Although the US central bank\u2019s balance sheet is arguably too large, the European Central Bank\u2019s balance sheet is larger, and the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s balance sheet is 50 per cent larger (based on central bank data as of August 31).<\/p><p>Political propaganda regarding US debt and the Fed\u2019s policies has influenced forecasts for the US dollar, and those forecasts have generally been too bearish. The tradable DXY index, which incorporates investors\u2019 expectations for the dollar, has appreciated more than 10 per cent from its April 2008 trough, and fears regarding the dollar\u2019s demise have been exaggerated.<\/p><p>Equity investors seem similarly misled, and appear too worried about inflation caused by misperceptions of US debt and Fed policies. According to our models, US equity investors are currently expecting nearly 6 per cent inflation for the next 12 months. With US inflation running at 2 per cent, the US equity market seems very undervalued.<\/p><p>The US economy\u2019s improvement is not as strong as the Democrats indicate, but it is also not as tenuous as the Republicans portray it. Investors have to ignore the political rhetoric, and accept the simple fact that the US economy is one of the few economies in the world that is actually improving at all. An objective re-evaluation of the risks might be bullish for the dollar and bullish for US assets in general.<\/p><p>Richard Bernstein is chief executive of Richard Bernstein Advisors <\/p>"},{"id":"33720871","uuid":"a175578c-272c-11e2-9863-00144feabdc0","title":"War of words erupts among rating agencies","catid":"8","byline":"By Stephen Foley in New York","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 11:51:31 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/a175578c-272c-11e2-9863-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"Kroll Bond Ratings says rivals do not do enough research into the underlying loans that are packaged into commercial mortgage-backed securities","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Capital Markets"},"share":{"webappemail":"PRgIjs","webappshare":"SsMr6x"},"popup":{"full":"http:\/\/im.ft-static.com\/content\/images\/28cf8738-2779-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0.img","preview":"http:\/\/im.ft-static.com\/content\/images\/25f91ce0-2779-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0.img"},"storypackage":[{"articleid":"33720551","title":"S&P misled investors, court finds"}]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 11:51:31 +0000","content":"<p>Jules Kroll leaned over the table and slapped down two documents, side by side. \u201cThis one is our report on the deal,\u201d he says, pointing to the (much) thicker of the two. \u201cThis little doily underneath is the DBRS report.\u201d<\/p><p>He slams down another two reports, one more than three times the size of the other. \u201cThis one is our credit rating,\u201d he says, tapping the thicker one. \u201cThis other one is Standard & Poor\u2019s report on the same deal. I can\u2019t believe they are putting out crap like this. People are entitled to know what all these deals are about.\u201d<\/p><p>Fighting talk from the founder of Kroll Bond Ratings, for sure, but it is a sign of the times. The rating agencies are at war.<\/p><p>The main theatre of battle right now is the business of rating commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), investments created from pools of loans on commercial property. Kroll has moved into third place in terms of the number of CMBS deals it has rated, behind Moody\u2019s and Fitch. S&P, the biggest of the traditional \u201cbig three\u201d agencies, had been frozen out for more than a year after admitting a flaw in its financial modelling of CMBS, but it has shaken up its team of analysts and is back, which is why the war of words has heated up.<\/p><p>The hope, for investors, is that a vigorous debate between the rating agencies over their methods for rating asset-backed securities will underpin standards \u2013 and, perhaps, not a moment too soon.<\/p><p>Investors have chased up CMBS prices this year, resulting in record low yields on the securities, and tighter spreads over benchmark US Treasuries. That has tempted issuers to put out CMBS with lower underwriting standards on the underlying loans, says Keerthi Raghavan, a CMBS strategist at Barclays.<\/p><p>\u201cBanks are widening their underwriting criteria, and it worsens after each period of spread tightening,\u201d he says. \u201cThere has been more tightening in the last month, so the underwriting is likely to get even worse in the coming months.\u201d<\/p><p>Having pioneered \u201ccorporate intelligence\u201d at his eponymous sleuthing agency, Mr Kroll made a late-career move into the business of credit ratings just three years ago. His pitch is that the \u201cbig three\u201d do not do nearly enough research into the underlying loans that are packaged up into CMBS and other structured finance products.<\/p><p>But it is not just Mr Kroll doing down his rivals. The big three have turned on each other, too. Twice in the past month, Moody\u2019s has published a report criticising an S&P rating on a new CMBS, on the first deal S&P rated after its return from hiatus, a $1.1bn offering by JPMorgan, and on a deal in the UK.<\/p><p>Last week, Fitch criticised a CMBS called NorthStar 2012-1, whose top tranche of securities were given triple A ratings by S&P and Moody\u2019s but which Fitch said deserved only an A grade, two full notches lower. It singled out the largest loan in the underlying pool, a mortgage on a retail park in Buena Park, California, for particular criticism, saying the park had too many vacant lots and the cinema there was suffering declining ticket sales. Fitch was concerned, it said, \u201cover stiff competition in the submarket, including healthier malls nearby\u201d.<\/p><p>S&P appears to have come in for most criticism in recent weeks. Moody\u2019s says its rival\u2019s rating criteria do not give enough weight to the risks in a pool that is heavily concentrated in a few big mortgages, or to the risks that even well-established malls could fall into decline in an age of internet shopping. Mr Kroll, meanwhile, argues S&P does not demand a large enough amount of extra collateral to justify the triple A ratings it gives to the top tranches of CMBS.<\/p><p>\u201cThey are prostituting themselves,\u201d Mr Kroll says, bluntly. In his view the agency is \u201cso far away from good criteria that it is dangerous. Their criteria require much less in the way of credit enhancement, and they are basically buying their way back into the market.\u201d<\/p><p>An S&P spokesman said: \u201cThe market benefits from a diversity of opinions on credit risk. Our ratings reflect our opinion of the creditworthiness of the securities in the transaction.\u201d <\/p><p>In private conversations with investors, S&P, Moody\u2019s and Fitch have all dismissed Mr Kroll\u2019s criticisms, saying that the size of a research report is no measure of its thoroughness, and that investors can be reassured by their longer histories and bigger staffs.<\/p><p>There are five other firms also certified as \u201cnationally recognised statistical rating organisations\u201d by the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Canada-based DBRS, which declined to respond to Mr Kroll\u2019s criticism.<\/p><p>Credit ratings are still paid for by issuers rather than investors, a system criticised for conflicts of interest that may have been a contributor to the credit crisis. In the absence of a change to that system, the debate between the agencies gives investors more to chew on when deciding how to weigh a credit rating on a new CMBS deal.<\/p><p>As Mr Kroll says of the public spats between Moody\u2019s, Fitch and S&P, \u201cthey are actually acting like competitors\u201d.<\/p>"},{"id":"33720891","uuid":"858f35b8-2738-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0","title":"Bumi receives approach from Rothschild","catid":"43","byline":"By Ben Bland in Jakarta and Helen Thomas in London","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 17:34:14 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/858f35b8-2738-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"The Indonesia-focused coal mining group has received a counter offer from the financier, under which the company would retain its London listing","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Mining"},"share":{"webappemail":"PRgIjr","webappshare":"SsMqQ2"},"stocks":{"id:BUMI":"Bumi Resources Tbk PT","uk:BUMI":"Bumi PLC"},"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 17:34:14 +0000","content":"<p>Bumi has received a proposal from Nat Rothschild, the financier, that could provide the Indonesia-focused coal miner with an alternative to the $1.4bn plan by Indonesia\u2019s influential Bakrie family to unwind the company after months of shareholder wrangling over corporate governance.<\/p><p>The London-listed company said in a statement on Monday that it had received a letter from Mr Rothschild\u2019s NR Investments \u201cproposing an alternative\u201d to the Bakries\u2019 suggestion that they buy back the Indonesian mining assets that they reversed into Mr Rothschild\u2019s cash shell, Vallar, in 2011.<\/p><p>The Financial Times reported last week that Mr Rothschild was assembling a group of investors to buy the Bakrie family and their associates out of the company and that a number of Indonesian tycoons, including general-turned-politician Prabowo Subianto, had been asked to join the consortium.<\/p><p>Bumi has been beset by corporate governance concerns and worries about the Bakries\u2019 debts.

The September 11 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, in which the US ambassador, Christopher Stevens, and three others were killed, damaged the business climate and demoralised entrepreneurs.

No rating agency had previously given Ankara investment grade since Moody\u2019s downgraded the country in 1994.<\/p><p>Mehmet Simsek, Turkey\u2019s finance minister, welcomed Fitch\u2019s upgrade, saying on Twitter that it was the result of political and macroeconomic stability during the current government\u2019s decade in office, following years of crisis.<\/p><p>\u201cThe credit rating upgrade to investment grade will support our growth forecasts and will even increase our growth performance,\u201d Mr Simsek said, referring to Ankara\u2019s plans for 5 per cent annual growth by 2014, compared with a level of about 3 per cent today.<\/p><p>Ed Parker, managing director at Fitch, said the upgrade reflected the underlying improvement in the country\u2019s balance of payments, noting that while the move could open Turkey up to a wider pool of investments, \u201cTurkish financial markets [have already] had a good run in recent months.\u201d<\/p><p>Fitch said the country\u2019s external finances \u201cremain a key rating weakness\u201d, highlighting it expected this year\u2019s current account deficit to total $58bn or 7.3 per cent of GDP.<\/p><p>In a nod to the political tensions facing Turkey over the fighting in its neighbour Syria \u2013 with which Ankara has frequently exchanged cross-border fire in recent weeks \u2013 Fitch said it was assuming the country would not be drawn into a \u201cfull-scale military conflict\u201d, an event that could lead to a downgrade.<\/p><p>It also assumed that Turkey would not be suspended from its membership in the inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force in an o dispute over Ankara\u2019s failure to pass and implement terrorist financing legislation \u2013 or that if the country was suspended, that it would \u201cnot precipitate countermeasures that materially adversely affect the capacity of Turkish entities to access international financing\u201d.<\/p><p>In a move that gave Turkey some months to resolve the dispute, FATF agreed last month to suspend Turkish membership effective from February next year. FATF has also sought to distinguish Turkey\u2019s membership of the group from its international blacklist, which at present only includes North Korea and Iran, and has helped to isolate both Pyongyang and Tehran.<\/p>"},{"id":"33720951","uuid":null,"title":"Chart of the week: mobile numbers start to add up for EMs","catid":"491","byline":"Rob Minto","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 12:54:15 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/blogs.ft.com\/beyond-brics\/2012\/11\/05\/chart-of-the-week-mobile-numbers-start-to-add-up-for-ems","snip":"As mobile phones approach worldwide ubiquity, it&#8217;s easy to see that the countries with the biggest populations will have the most connections, with China and India in the lead.","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":null},"share":{"webappemail":"PRndTf","webappshare":"PRlIV6"},"protectionlevel":"free"},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 12:54:15 +0000","content":"<p><a onclick=\"if (mFT.openExternal) return mFT.openExternal(this)\" href=\"http:\/\/blogs.r.ftdata.co.uk\/beyond-brics\/files\/2012\/11\/136435818.jpg\"><img class=\"inline-article-image\" onerror=\"this.style.visibility='hidden'\" src=\"http:\/\/blogs.r.ftdata.co.uk\/beyond-brics\/files\/2012\/11\/136435818-167x93.jpg\"167\" data-orig-height=\"93\" \/><\/a>As mobile phones approach worldwide ubiquity, it&#8217;s easy to see that the countries with the biggest populations will have the most connections, with China and India in the lead.<\/p><p>But which companies are serving those customers?

And the big western-based big mobile companies also have a strong presence in emerging markets. Vodafone (2nd with 387m subscribers) is big in India and South Africa; Telefonica (5th, 243m) has over two-thirds of its customers in Latin America; and Telenor of Norway (9th, 205m) has extensive operations in Asia.<\/p><p>So with their longer-established businesses, why aren&#8217;t western-based operators making more headway in emerging markets? The answer is that in a heavily-regulated sector, governments often favour the locals, at least in the early stages of market development. Later on, the successful local companies establish strong positions, which foreign groups struggle to overcome.<\/p><p>For example, China has the most mobile phone users in the world, but access to them via foreign operators is almost nil. The three state operators are utterly dominant. The market was protected prior to China&#8217;s WTO accession, and is only slowly opening up. Between them China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom have over 1bn customers. And several foreign operators have tried investing in or with the state operators, only to withdraw &#8211; <a onclick=\"if (mFT.openExternal) return mFT.openExternal(this)\" title=\"WSJ\" href=\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB10001424052748703453804575479264043544420.html\" target=\"_blank\">Vodafone sold it&#8217;s stake in China Mobile back in 2010<\/a>, reflecting the reduced need of the Chinese operator for established western know-how.<\/p><p><a onclick=\"if (mFT.openExternal) return mFT.openExternal(this)\" title=\"India: lost connections\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/2f2bd0fa-f34e-11e1-9ca6-00144feabdc0.html\">India<\/a> is another country that has huge potential, given the population size. But the market is difficult for all operators, as the over-allocation of licences and spectrum has meant too many competing services and fierce competition.

In emerging markets where incomes are much smaller, there are still people without phones, and those with phones are typically on more basic models.

But analysts say many of these businessmen have been able to rebuild their empires thanks to the robust economic recovery of the last decade.<\/p><p>The Riadys, who are one of the most outward-looking of the ethnic Chinese families that control much of Indonesia\u2019s economy, are likely to be significant players in this consolidation process.<\/p><p>The family\u2019s Lippo Group was built by 83-year-old Mochtar Riady, who made his name as a banker for Liem Sioe Liong, the recently deceased tycoon who dominated Indonesian business under the rule of dictator General Suharto, who was ousted in 1998.<\/p><p>Lippo\u2019s day-to-day interests are now controlled by two of his children, James, who handles Indonesia, and Stephen, who is in charge of Singapore and the rest of Asia.<\/p><p>Stephen, who lives in a multimillion dollar seafront villa in the exclusive Sentosa Cove estate in Singapore, sees the possible F&N deal as a way to expand the family\u2019s Asian property business, according to a person familiar with his thinking.<\/p><p>The Riadys took control of property group OUE in 2006 alongside Malaysian businessman Ananda Krishnan before buying out his stake in 2010 as the two sides embarked on a lengthy legal dispute over a separate TV joint venture.<\/p><p>By acquiring further premium assets, such as the headquarters of leading bank DBS, and investing in existing hotel, office and retail properties to boost rental income, Stephen, who owns 67 per cent of OUE, has built a company with a market capitalisation of S$2.4bn.<\/p><p>Analysts say F&N is likely to be attractive to Lippo because its property businesses \u2013 from serviced apartments in London\u2019s upmarket South Kensington district to the Centrepoint shopping malls in Singapore \u2013 appear undervalued.<\/p><p>But financing an offer for F&N, which has a market capitalisation of S$13.1bn, will be a challenge for Lippo, especially as Mr Charoen already owns just over 30 per cent of F&N. <\/p><p>People familiar with the situation say Stephen is working hard to find partners for a bid. Analysts suggest that Kirin, the Japanese beer and soft drinks group that owns 15 per cent of F&N, would be a logical partner as it wants to expand in soft drinks in southeast Asia where F&N has a strong branded drinks franchise.<\/p><p>Even if the Riadys are unable to pull off this takeover, people who have worked for them say that they are likely to forge ahead with other large deals in Asia.<\/p><p>\u201cCompared with most Indonesian conglomerates, they\u2019re much more outward looking,\u201d says James Van Zorge, a former consultant for the Riadys who now works for AT Kearney, an international management consultancy, in Jakarta. <\/p><p>\u201cBoth Stephen and James are very aggressive businessmen, skilful dealmakers, tough negotiators.

I&#8217;d expect even more of a groundswell of interest in brands such as Harry Winston and Tiffany. After all, luxury loves nothing so much as a trend.<\/p><p>Second, the deal also further bolsters the theory that, post-<a onclick=\"mFT.router.loadArticle(33299811, null, null, null, true); return false;\" title=\"FT post\" href=\"http:\/\/blogs.ft.com\/material-world\/2012\/09\/17\/more-middle-eastern-money-pours-into-high-fashion\/\">Valentino<\/a>, Harrods and Anya Hindmarch sales to Qatar, the buyers are in the Middle East these days. (The Qataris already own part of Tiffany.) Investcorp, after all, is the Bahrain-listed PE firm that once owned Tiffany and Gucci.<\/p><p>Otherwise, the Jensen news also suggests three important, if less concrete, developments to watch:<\/p><p>1. that reports of the death of PE interest in luxury have been greatly exaggerated. Despite acknowledging that &#8220;the way they [Investcorp] are speaking, they probably plan to hold us for 5-7 years,&#8221; said Ulrik Garde Due, Jensen CEO, who was talking to me before taking off to meet his new owners in Dubai tomorrow. He thinks PE is a good thing for Jensen and said there were also industrial buyers interested (read: private owners), but between Investcorp&#8217;s balance sheet, and the drive to push a brand to the next level to make money when they sell it on, it&#8217;s the right partner. So there may be more action there.<\/p><p>2. that the rumoured slowdown in gifting in China may actually be more like a swerve. Mr Garde Due said one of the attractions of Jensen was its under-penetration of markets such as Asia, and its offering of high-design silver pieces by names such as Arne Jacobsen, Henning Kopple and Verner Panton, all of which have great insider (ie non-bling) pedigrees. He thinks there is huge opportunity in home gifting in China, and pointed out that David Chu, founder of Nautica, would be his new co-chairman. Home brands: get ready to launch!<\/p><p>3. And finally, that associating a luxury brand with national identity can produce significant equity value. This is increasingly a strategy among European heritage brands, but Jensen has taken it a step further, so its products are not just &#8220;made in Denmark,&#8221; but specifically pitched as representing Danish aesthetics. Mr Garde Due acknowledged that the effort to make Jensen &#8220;an ambassador&#8221; for Denmark had paid off. (Their new ad campaign, by the way, features &#8220;Great Danes&#8221;.)<\/p><p>So all in all, a pretty interesting start to the week.<\/p>","protectionlevel":"free"},{"id":"33721041","uuid":"f45407fa-1e21-11e2-8e1d-00144feabdc0","title":"Reckitt targets flu sufferers online","catid":"62","byline":"By Emily Steel in New York","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 14:06:40 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/f45407fa-1e21-11e2-8e1d-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"Tie-up between Reckitt Benckiser and WebMD is a window into the future of marketing, when advertisers will monitor consumers\u2019 activities in real time","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Pharmaceuticals"},"share":{"webappemail":"PRvDKl","webappshare":"SnsD4h"},"stocks":{"us:WBMD":"WebMD Health Corp"},"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 14:06:40 +0000","content":"<p>Reckitt Benckiser is attempting to offer relief for colds and flu faster than outbreaks of the viruses that cause them, through a partnership with WebMD.com.<\/p><p>The health site\u2019s symptom checker facility is analysing users\u2019 queries to identify existing symptoms such as fever, aches and pain, and coughs, and to predict the next stage of the illness.<\/p><p>Reckitt, which makes Mucinex cold and flu medication as well as brands such as Lysol disinfectant, is then targeting its ads at consumers, based on the likely course of their illness.<\/p><p>The strategy is a window into the future of marketing, in which advertisers will monitor consumers\u2019 activities in real time, then use the data to tailor and target their messages.

Starting as a \u201cblue button\u201d, the lowest form of life on the stock exchange back in the Cretaceous, he rose to middling executive rank at brokers such as Phillips & Drew and Tullett. It all went wrong when he struck out on his own. He ended up creating a Ponzi scheme: stealing money from new investors to pay the debts of old ones even as he prayed for an investment jackpot that never came.<\/p><p>Levene was a lightweight as Ponzi operators go, losing just \u00a325m compared with the $18bn dematerialised by Bernie Madoff. The release date for the New York fraudster is over a century away. The Londoner, who is 48, should be out in seven years. Some say his sentence is long \u2013 Asil Nadir got 10 years for deceiving a legion of small investors. But penalties for white collar crime remain light compared with those for the blue collar variety<\/p><p>How did this chancer convince businessmen as acute as Sir Brian to trust him? The same way legitimate counterparts might. With an aura of wealth and invincibility. Throw parties on yachts, promise market-beating returns and it is surprising who will sign up to your schemes.<\/p><p>HSBC\u2019s better natureThird-quarter results from HSBC told a tale of two banks. One is a high-handed institution that riles US regulators, who may respond with punitive fines. The other is a prudent business that reduces loan risks and shrinks its investment bank to fit straitened markets. Will the real HSBC please stand up?<\/p><p>At the racy incarnation of HSBC, \u201cThink of a number, then more than double it\u201d is the method for calculating US liabilities for alleged money laundering. Monday\u2019s $800m provision took the total to $1.5bn. Legal advisers had underestimated how tough US watchdogs were likely to be when settlement negotiations commenced. <\/p><p>We can hypothesise that Standard Chartered\u2019s $340m settlement with the New York Department of Financial services for alleged Iranian sanctions breaches has recalibrated penalties in the US towards the vengeful end of the dial.<\/p><p>No regulator is likely to get fired for spanking banks hard in the wake of the credit crunch. Nor are US watchdogs required to offset one another\u2019s fines. But to complain that the unpredictability of the system deters investment is morally suspect. The riposte is that sticking to the spirit of the law is the only policy.<\/p><p>The prudent avatar of HSBC might agree. It has been shifting its emphasis from unsecured to secured lending, which helped shrink loan impairments $2.6bn to $6.5bn, contributing to a $2.6bn rise in nine-month profits to $14.9bn before tweaks for the value of the bank\u2019s debts. <\/p><p>Investment banking profits were about $1.5bn stronger. The better tone of credit markets was largely responsible. But HSBC should also win market share with a division focused on supporting corporate borrowers, even as rivals contract. <\/p><p>With HSBC under reforming management in the shape of Stuart Gulliver, the bank\u2019s better nature looks set to win control of its divided self. Bernstein forecasts a healthy return on tangible net asset value of 13.2 per cent in 2012, justifying investment in a stock that trades at a premium to peers.<\/p><p>Slick as a parrotFastJet has added a parrot to the menagerie of corporate mascots. The low-cost African airline, created by Lonrho and entrepreneur Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, has even picked a species \u2013 the African Grey. This will feature in the logo and on the tail fins of its 10 aircraft. <\/p><p>The impulse to represent a collective endeavour with a popular animal is ancient. Its effectiveness as an outlet for modern branding depends on execution and context. Comparison website Comparethemarket.com has made brilliant promotional use of meerkats. In contrast, ING Direct\u2019s puppet lion is wooden in both senses of the word. It does not help that the male lion, a traditional emblem of nobility, is a lazy freeloader in real life.<\/p><p>African Greys are clever, which suits FastJet\u2019s aspiration to offer \u201csmart travel\u201d. They are also long-lived. Quite different to the mythic Norwegian Blue of Monty Python\u2019s Dead Parrot Sketch which, in the words of John Cleese had \u201cshuffled off his mortal coil ... and joined the choir invisible\u201d. FastJet will doubtless prove more durable.<\/p>"},{"id":"33721061","uuid":null,"title":"Smart Reads November 5, 2012","catid":"146","byline":"Amie Tsang","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 14:15:32 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/blogs.ft.com\/the-world\/2012\/11\/smart-reads-november-5-2012","snip":"The US will go to the polls shortly, to choose between what Ed Luce refers to as the gamble or the devil we know.\nThe FT has endorsed Barack Obama for","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":null},"share":{"webappemail":"PRvEhv","webappshare":"SnsI7S"},"protectionlevel":"free"},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 14:15:32 +0000","content":"<p><ul><\/p><p><li>The US will go to the polls shortly, to choose between what Ed Luce refers to as <a onclick=\"if (mFT.openExternal) return mFT.openExternal(this)\" title=\"US choice - a gamble or the devil we know - FT.com\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/e96994de-2440-11e2-94d0-00144feabdc0.html\" target=\"_blank\">the gamble or the devil we know.<\/a><\/li><\/p><p><li>The FT has endorsed Barack Obama for this election and provoked plenty of chatter online \u2014 <a onclick=\"if (mFT.openExternal) return mFT.openExternal(this)\" title=\"Obama is the wiser bet for crisis-hit US - FT.com\" href=\" Four years on from the financial crisis, with extreme inequality an affront to the American dream, there remains a need for intelligent, reformist governance.

Spain bewildered"}]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 15:04:41 +0000","content":"<p>The perfect central bank action is costless; words alone do the trick. So far, that is exactly what Mario Draghi, European Central Bank president, has achieved in the case of Spain.<\/p><p>It is more than three months since Mr Draghi first hinted at unlimited ECB intervention in bond markets to preserve the eurozone\u2019s integrity. The ECB has not spent a cent. Yet investor sentiment has turned. Spanish 10-year government bond yields have fallen from a peak of more than 7.5 per cent in late July \u2013 a level that threatened the sustainability of Madrid\u2019s finances \u2013 to 5.76 per cent, just off a seven-month low.<\/p><p>Mr Draghi set as a precondition for ECB purchases an agreement by Spain on an economic bailout programme drawn up by the EU and the International Monetary Fund. He did not necessarily expect Madrid to draw additional external funds \u2013 but wanted \u201cconditionality\u201d, or outside-imposed pressure, to push through further structural and fiscal reforms. That would provide political cover for his actions, perhaps assuaging German worries.<\/p><p>With bond market pressures considerably eased without the ECB actually intervening, Madrid can now reasonably ask: why should it bother?<\/p><p>If this seems like circular thinking, that is because it is. The deception is that markets have slashed Madrid\u2019s borrowing costs because they assume Spain will enter a programme and the ECB will provide a backstop \u2013 nobody in European capital markets sees any alternative. But as long as yields remain low, Madrid can resist the external control over its economy that would be required for the ECB to act.<\/p><p>The trick could continue to work for a while yet. Investors were disappointed initially when Mr Draghi\u2019s July pledge, followed by the formal unveiling on September 6 of his \u201coutright monetary transactions\u201d (OMT) programme, was not accompanied by immediate bond buying. But, currently, markets appear reconciled to Spanish politics resulting in further delays \u2013 perhaps beyond elections in the economically powerful region of Catalonia on November 25.<\/p><p>Even if markets did start to test Madrid and push yields higher, Spain\u2019s political leaders would not have to rush. The country has already achieved 95 per cent of its target bond issuance this year. Rather than straining Madrid\u2019s finances further, the average cost of funding Spanish debt has actually fallen, to 3.4 per cent this year from 3.9 per cent in 2011, according to calculations by UniCredit, partly because it is issuing shorter-term bonds. Paying a higher rate at the next few auctions would make scant difference.<\/p><p>On one view, financial markets are now pricing Spanish debt fairly. A rule of thumb is that yields on government bonds, which move inversely to prices, should be in line with nominal (rather than real, inflation-adjusted) economic growth. Assuming, fairly conservatively, that Spain\u2019s economy can expand at a nominal 4 per cent a year over the long term, the yield on a five-year Spanish bond (about the average maturity) at below 4.5 per cent would not appear unreasonable.<\/p><p>But it is a fragile peace with financial markets, and an ugly stand-off still seems inevitable if Madrid does not eventually agree the terms for ECB intervention. The longer Mariano Rajoy, Spain\u2019s prime minister, delays, the more financial markets are likely to fret about a potentially expensive Spanish constitutional crisis triggered by regional tensions. They will also scrutinise more carefully possible flaws in the ECB\u2019s plans: what, for instance, happens if a country refuses to fulfil the requirements for the launch of its OMT programme? <\/p><p>If it became clear that Spain was seriously intent on sidestepping an agreed bailout programme, its bond market could see a swift correction. With Spain\u2019s financing needs expected to increase significantly next year on the back of a weakening economy, higher yields would bring considerable strains \u2013 all the more so as foreign demand for its government bonds has evaporated.<\/p><p>There is no point at which a government\u2019s interest payments suddenly become unsustainable; it takes time for elevated bond yields to feed through into average debt financing costs. But battles with bond markets take on a psychological dimension. Once Spanish 10-year bonds hit 6 per cent earlier this year, they quickly jumped above 7 per cent, points out Chiara Cremonesi, strategist at UniCredit. While Madrid may feel it has the better of bond markets at the moment, conjuring acts cannot fool them for ever.<\/p>"},{"id":"33721111","uuid":"0897f0d0-2748-11e2-9863-00144feabdc0","title":"Libya helps bankroll Syrian opposition","catid":"76","byline":"By Borzou Daragahi in Cairo","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 14:54:26 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/0897f0d0-2748-11e2-9863-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"Tripoli has emerged as the biggest single contributing government to the Syrian National Council\u2019s $40m budget, followed by Qatar and the UAE","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Middle Eastern Politics & Society"},"share":{"webappemail":"PRDh7D","webappshare":"TFGgPw"},"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 14:54:26 +0000","content":"<p>The top financier of the Syrian opposition is no Arabian Peninsula oil kingdom or cloak-and-dagger western spy outfit, but struggling, war-ravaged Libya, which is itself recovering from a devastating civil conflict.<\/p><p>According to a budget released by the Syrian National Council and posted to its website late on Sunday, the Libyan government contributed $20.3m of the $40.4m that the opposition umbrella group has amassed since its creation in August 2011.<\/p><p>Qatar gave $15m while the United Arab Emirates contributed $5m, according to the document.<\/p><p>Unlike Qatar and the UAE, which are absolute monarchies, Libya has embarked on a rocky path towards democracy and shares an ideological vision with Syrian revolutionaries.<\/p><p>Oil-rich Libya has emerged as one of the Syrian uprising\u2019s firmest and earliest backers.

Its interim foreign minister said earlier this year that his government could not prevent or condemn Libyans heading to Syria to fight.<\/p><p>The Libyan government was among the first Arab nations to sever ties with the regime in Damascus.

According to the document, the SNC still has about $10.7m in the bank.<\/p><p>The report breaks down expenditures by both category and geography. According to the six-page document, 11 per cent of the money collected has been spent on overheads, with the rest devoted to aiding Syrians inside the country or refugees in neighbouring states.<\/p><p>Roughly 7 per cent of the funds, or about $2.8m, has been allocated to the Free Syrian Army. About $290,000 has been spent on hotels for SNC representatives during travels abroad. The organisation spent about $160,000 on relief efforts for the two mostly ethnic Kurdish provinces of northwest Syria.<\/p><p>The release of the budget report comes as the organisation faces international pressure to join a more broad-based body of the Syrian opposition, effectively diluting its influence. Last week, US secretary of state Hillary Clinton called for a new body to better represent groups on the ground inside Syria.<\/p><p>In an apparent attempt to shore up its status ahead of a meeting later this week to discuss the US-backed proposals, the SNC announced on Monday that it would expand its membership to include more people from inside Syria. <\/p><p>Syria itself was shaken by another day of heavy violence on Monday. A suicide bomber killed at least 50 regime soldiers in the central province of Hama, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a pro-opposition monitoring group.

After a slow start, tablets using the search group's free operating system have now put a \u201csizable dent\u201d in Apple's tablet market share, IDC, an analyst group, said on Monday.\u00a0<\/p><p>Apple\u2019s share of worldwide tablet shipments fell from 59.7 per cent a year ago to 50.4 per cent in the three months to the end of September, IDC said, while Samsung\u2019s leapt from 6.5 per cent to 18.4 per cent.\u00a0<\/p><p>Amazon\u00a0has captured 9 per cent of the market with its Kindle Fire products, after less than a year on sale.

Analysts had expected sales of at least 1m for the iPad mini this weekend but investors have been concerned about supply shortages holding back shipments of the iPad mini and iPhone 5.\u00a0<\/p><p>Android\u2019s progress in tablets still lags behind its dominance in smartphones. IDC says it held a 75 per cent share of the global market in the third quarter, up from 57.5 per cent a year ago, growing largely at the expense of Research In Motion\u2019s BlackBerry and Nokia\u2019s Symbian. Apple\u2019s iOS has expanded to a 14.9 per cent share of smartphone shipments over the past year.\u00a0<\/p><p>Anticipation of the release of the new iPads had caused many potential tablet buyers to earlier hold off from purchasing, according to IDC. <\/p><p>\u201cNow that the new mini, and a fourth-generation, full-sized iPad, are both shipping, we expect Apple to have a very good quarter,\u201d said Tom Mainelli, IDC\u2019s research director for tablets. \u201cHowever, we believe the mini\u2019s relatively high $329 starting price leaves plenty of room for Android vendors to build upon the success they achieved in the third quarter.\u201d<\/p><p>Apple posted 26.1 per cent growth in shipments over the past year, according to IDC, a rate far outpaced by its smaller rivals.

The procedure, Christians say, allows the final choice to be made by God.<\/p><p>Now that the Almighty has made his will known, an important question for the Coptic community will be if Mohamed Morsi, Egypt\u2019s Islamist president who hails from the Muslim Brotherhood, will be present at the ceremony marking the enthronement of the pope on November 18.<\/p><p>The Coptic church has been given to understand that Mr Morsi might not attend, but would visit the papal offices to offer his congratulations. However, much rides on Mr Morsi\u2019s decision.<\/p><p>If the\u00a0president were to be shown on television attending Christian prayers as a courtesy to his Coptic citizens, estimated at 10 per cent of the 83m-strong population, it would send a reassuring\u00a0message to a frightened community that views the future with trepidation now that\u00a0Islamists, including ultraconservative Salafi hardliners, have come to political dominance.<\/p><p>Christians have noted that senior leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood and of Freedom and Justice, its political arm and the biggest party in Egypt, visited the main Cairo cathedral to offer their condolences when the previous patriarch died, but none stayed for the televised funeral, which was regarded as a national event.<\/p><p>Their reluctance to appear at the funeral mass was interpreted as a desire to avoid hurting the sensitivities of religious hardliners, some of whom charge that the presence of Muslims at Christian prayers amounts to an endorsement of infidel practices.<\/p><p>Similarly, although Mr Morsi promised before his election in June to appoint a woman and a Christian as vice-presidents, he backed down after criticism from hardliners who said it would be religiously unacceptable. \u00a0<\/p><p>To Egypt\u2019s Christian minority, which complains of mounting discrimination, sectarian tensions and periodic outbursts of violence against it, the political atmosphere is ominous as Salafi parties try to impose their world view on a new constitution that is being drafted. <\/p><p>Compounding their anxiety, attacks against Christians and their churches have increased since the ousting of Hosni Mubarak as president last year, and the new climate of freedom has allowed extremist voices, previously repressed, to express views that border on hate speech.<\/p><p>Mr Morsi himself\u00a0has been emphasising his religious credentials by attending televised Friday prayers every week at a different province since he became president in July.<\/p><p>His more secular-minded subjects, both Muslim and Christian, say the time has come to deliver on his pledge to be a president for all Egyptians\u00a0by ceasing to\u00a0mollify the hardliners. At a time when a new order is being born, they argue, Mr Morsi\u00a0needs to be decisive as to\u00a0the nature of the state he is helping to construct: will it be a modern, democratic state in which all citizens are equal, or will it be one in which religious minorities are viewed as second-class citizens?<\/p><p>Recent incidents have suggested a strong possibility that the latter vision will triumph. A young Coptic man is in prison facing charges of contempt of religion because he shared an anti-Islamic video on Facebook, while an Islamist broadcaster who faces similar charges for tearing up the Bible in public is not being held. <\/p><p>Meanwhile the authorities have been tardy to react to the disappearance of a 14-year-old Christian girl said to have converted to Islam and married a Muslim in breach of laws setting a minimum age for both actions.

Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re has been the creative director of Balenciaga since 1997.<\/p><p>Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, chairman and chief executive of PPR, said: &#8220;Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga was a master, a genius whose avant-garde vision dictated fashion\u2019s greatest trends and inspired generations of designers. With an incomparable creative talent, Nicolas has brought to Balenciaga an artistic contribution essential to the unique influence of the house.&#8221;\"<\/p><p>Well, that&#8217;s revealing! Or, not.<\/p><p>It&#8217;s also pretty understated, considering what Mr Ghesqui\u00e8re had done for the brand.<span id=\"more-50621\"><\/span><\/p><p>He&#8217;d been at Balenciaga 15 years (a lifetime in these high-designer-turnover days), and had done as much as anyone to transform it from venerated-but-irrelevant brand into the perennial hottest ticket at Paris Fashion Week (which, when you think about the pressure that generates, is a pretty extraordinary thing). He proved the way a talented designer could abstract heritage to transform a brand&#8217;s identity into something truly modern, and struck gold with that biker bag for a brand that had never been known for his <em>accessoires<\/em>.<\/p><p>Oddly, the house does not seem to have anyone else lined up for the gig. If this was mutual and long in coming, you would have expected them to counterbalance this news, which will send seismic tremors through the fashion industry that adores Mr Ghesqui\u00e8re, with some other news about who&#8217;s next. And if not for the fashionistas, then for the analysts who track PPR and presumably know how important Mr G was to the brand&#8217;s success &#8212; and by association, that of its parent group.<\/p><p>Maybe the PPR execs were trying not to steal Mr Ghesquiere&#8217;s thunder (a spokesperson told me &#8220;today is about Nicolas&#8221;), but really, it doesn&#8217;t take away from his leaving to say someone else is coming. And maybe they were trying to limit the speculation and fashion hoo-ha &#8212; good luck with that.<\/p><p>So what do we think happened? According to a Balenciaga spokesperson, they had been talking to Mr Ghesqui\u00e8re for a few months about his desire to &#8220;do something else&#8221;. My guess would be that could mean anything from &#8220;do something more&#8221; to &#8220;get more investment&#8221;, but whatever it was, they clearly could not reach an agreement, so agreed to disagree. The chief executive, Isabelle Guichot, is staying in place, so it&#8217;s not because of that (often, when a CEO changes, designers change too.)<\/p><p>There&#8217;s also the issue of the incredible investment PPR is making in <a onclick=\"if (mFT.openExternal) return mFT.openExternal(this)\" title=\"FT post\" href=\"http:\/\/http:\/\/blogs.ft.com\/material-world\/2012\/03\/07\/the-second-coming-of-hedi-slimane-at-ysl\/#axzz2BMRl21Fo\">Yves Saint Laurent<\/a>, and the extreme latitude they are giving their new designer, Hedi Slimane, to stay in Los Angeles, redo all the stores, redo the <a onclick=\"mFT.router.loadArticle(32573551, null, null, null, true); return false;\" title=\"FT post\" href=\"http:\/\/blogs.ft.com\/material-world\/2012\/06\/21\/yves-saint-laurent-has-a-new-coke-moment\/#axzz2BMRl21Fo\">logo<\/a> etc. It must have rankled a bit with the long-serving Mr Ghesqui\u00e8re. Balenciaga was only recently allowed to advertise, and for ages held its shows in its headquarters to save money (the shows are back there after a few seasons at the Crillon, by the way).<\/p><p>Meanwhile, PPR has been through this sort of upheavel before &#8212; they experienced it with Tom Ford and Domenico de Sole, when they left Gucci Group &#8212; so they know super-fashion-darlings can leave a brand and that brand can survive, and even thrive.<\/p><p>So ends the speculation.

And the key to the performance gap lines largely in fiscal policy.<\/p><p>Poland bigger than the other three combined, was always in a better position to resist the global headwinds because of the size of its internal market, and was only one not to fall into recession in 2009.<\/p><p>Slovakia did suffer a steep decline in GDP in 2009, as did Hungary and the Czech Republic. But but of these three only Slovakia&#8217;s economy is larger now than it was when the crisis first hit.<\/p><p>One of the factors in Poland&#8217;s resilience is the flexibility of having its own currency, which lost value in 2009, giving a boost to exporters.<\/p><p>But that does not account for Slovakia&#8217;s strong performance. Slovakia joined the euro in 2009, and its entry exchange rate was set when the whole region was booming, which boosted currencies and should have made it difficult for Slovakia to compete once the European economy soured.<\/p><p>Fisher writes:<\/p><blockquote><p>Slovakia did see a sharp drop in exports in 2009, but not significantly worse than the decline in other central European countries. Moreover, Slovak exports have since recovered strongly and outperformed the rest of the region in 2011 and into 2012. The Czech Republic\u2019s exports have also risen more rapidly than those of Poland and Hungary in the 2011-12 period, despite a more modest currency depreciation.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Monetary policy also fails to explain the discrepancy. Slovakia has had low rates thanks to the European Central Bank, while the Czech National Bank keeps its benchmark rate even lower \u2013 however, the two countries have seen very different outcomes. By the same token, tight monetary policies in Poland and Hungary have coincided with growth in Poland and a recession in Hungary.<\/p><p><a onclick=\"if (mFT.openExternal) return mFT.openExternal(this)\" href=\"http:\/\/blogs.r.ftdata.co.uk\/beyond-brics\/files\/2012\/11\/Visegradeconomictable2012.png\"><img class=\"inline-article-image\" onerror=\"this.style.visibility='hidden'\" src=\"http:\/\/blogs.r.ftdata.co.uk\/beyond-brics\/files\/2012\/11\/Visegradeconomictable2012.png\"592\" data-orig-height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p><p>Differences in fiscal policy seem more important (see CEPA table above).

Poland and Slovakia, which have seen the best economic results in recent years, have also had the highest budget deficits, as their governments eased fiscal policies in an attempt to mitigate the impact of the 2008-09 crisis.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Both Hungary and the Czech Republic adopted more austere fiscal policies &#8211; Hungary under pressure from the IMF, and the Czechs out of what seems to be innate fiscal conservatism.<\/p><p>All four countries are now aiming to get their deficits below the EU&#8217;s required 3 per cent, which involves tax hikes and spending cuts.

That statement would send the oil tanker industry, where the Norwegian billionaire is the world\u2019s highest-profile shipowner, into a spin. In the oil services sector, where his SeaDrill company is a dominant participant, the implications are a bit less dramatic. Mr Fredriksen\u2019s $3bn deal to sell Seadrill\u2019s tender rig business to Malaysia\u2019s SapuraKencana is more a repositioning than an exit. Selling the production-focused tender rigs will enable SeaDrill to build more vessels for deepwater exploration and development, where the oil and gas industry\u2019s biggest challenges lie.<\/p><p>The deal looks transformative for SapuraKencana, the product of a merger in May of two Malaysian oil services groups. The price is hefty. The acquisition cost, which Citi estimates at $1.7bn before capital expenditure and debt, will lift the Malaysian group\u2019s ratio of debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation from 4.5 to 5, though it should fall back to its starting level in a couple of years because of the strong earnings momentum of the rigs being acquired (most are in Asian waters). It gives SapuraKencana more heft in its backyard, however, by lifting it to first place in the global tender rig market.<\/p><p>SeaDrill, the listed company Mr Fredriksen controls, will continue to have skin in the game, doubling its stake in SapuraKencana to 13 per cent; he will also join its board. The Norwegian company should also net about $1.2bn in cash from the transaction. That will allow it to cut debt, though there are apparently no plans for a special dividend.<\/p><p>The shift from production-focused rigs to exploration and development fits SeaDrill\u2019s ambitions in deepwater drilling. Moreover, oil services is a sector that both depends on other people\u2019s spending plans and caters to their every whim.

Meanwhile, in California, duelling ballot measures could solidify fiscal improvements made under Governor Jerry Brown or lead to downgrades of numerous school districts, depending on the way the votes fall on Tuesday.<\/p><p>While the 174 ballot measures in 37 states are diverse, repeated themes include attempts to limit the freedom of politicians to improve local finances through tax rises and limits on collective bargaining by government employees, says Douglas Offerman, a state credit analyst at Fitch.<\/p><p>\u201cObviously taxes are an issue of high sensitivity among voters at a time when the economy is recovering only slowly,\u201d he said, but tax-raising freedom is a key element of governments\u2019 creditworthiness. \u201cPart of the reason that states have strong credit ratings is that they have such flexibility, so it\u2019s something we are attuned to as credit analysts and whether that flexibility is being changed by voters.\u201d<\/p><p>One of the most keenly watched ballot measures is Mr Brown\u2019s \u201cProposition 30\u201d in California, which seeks to raise $8.5bn in the coming year through tax increases on people earning more than $250,000 a year and through a rise in sales taxes. An alternative measure, Proposition 38, would raise more revenue but earmark most of it for education instead of making it available for general purposes, such as backing California\u2019s outstanding general obligation bonds.<\/p><p>Neither proposition had the support of more than 50 per cent of California\u2019s voters in recent polls.

In Oklahoma, there are proposals to lower the cap on annual increases in property valuations and to disallow the assessment of intangible property for taxes. In Florida, two proposed constitutional amendments would constrain income through more restrictive revenue limitations for the state and caps on annual assessed value increases on property for local government taxes, Fitch said.<\/p>"},{"id":"33721331","uuid":"254f7a40-274d-11e2-9863-00144feabdc0","title":"An astute chronicler of power relations","catid":"98","byline":"By Gordon Cramb","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 16:49:17 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/254f7a40-274d-11e2-9863-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"John Bourne was an astute chronicler of British politics and industrial relations during the 1960s and 1970s when each greatly affected the other","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Obituaries"},"share":{"webappemail":"SO6rUt","webappshare":"StAPjC"},"image":true,"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 16:49:17 +0000","content":"<p>John Bourne 1926-2012 Journalist<\/p><p>John Bourne, who has died aged 86, was an astute chronicler of British politics and industrial relations at a time when each had a particularly big impact on the other.<\/p><p>After joining the Financial Times in 1960 as a labour reporter for what turned out to be four years, he spent another dozen covering Westminster, ultimately as lobby editor.

After that February poll narrowly handed Downing Street back to Labour\u2019s Harold Wilson, Bourne and his friend Ian Aitken of The Guardian published unauthorised advance extracts from the Tory manifesto for the contest in October, creating a furore on the right once its outcome strengthened Wilson\u2019s hand.<\/p><p>Bourne felt obliged to hire solicitors to scotch rightwing press claims that he was a Labour loyalist. That came amid a police investigation into the source of the leak, in which those interviewed included Jean Stead \u2013 the Guardian news editor and Bourne\u2019s wife since their days on the Yorkshire Post. She survives him along with their daughter Victoria and son Matthew.<\/p><p>Taken together with an earlier tussle with Tribune, the manifesto episode indicated that he was beholden to neither camp. The Labour-linked journal, after a reader\u2019s letter in 1964 had misrepresented Bourne\u2019s radio comments on action being taken by postal and power workers, ran an apology saying: \u201cWe are completely satisfied that Mr Bourne did not in any way appear to take sides in the dispute, and at no time did he refer to the unions as \u2018dreadful\u2019.\u201d<\/p><p>After the lobby, Bourne became features editor and then helped found the Weekend FT, his career unimpeded by partial paralysis when an exploratory operation went wrong.

On retiring in 1987, oarsmanship became the last of the topics about which he regularly wrote.<\/p>"},{"id":"33721341","uuid":"dc6fe350-2747-11e2-9863-00144feabdc0","title":"IMF warning adds to French economy fears","catid":"75","byline":"By Hugh Carnegy in Paris","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 16:59:39 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/dc6fe350-2747-11e2-9863-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"In its annual report on the country, the fund called for \u2018a comprehensive programme of structural reforms\u2019 to prevent it falling behind Italy and Spain","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Europe"},"share":{"webappemail":"StJKS5","webappshare":"RMevkq"},"storypackage":[{"articleid":"33721091","title":"Madrid clings to truce with bond markets"}]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 16:59:39 +0000","content":"<p>France risks falling behind crisis-hit Italy and Spain if it does not reform its economy, the International Monetary Fund has warned, adding to pressure on President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande to stem the country\u2019s industrial decline.<\/p><p>In its annual report on the French economy, the IMF on Monday called for \u201ca comprehensive programme of structural reforms\u201d.<\/p><p>Predicting economic growth of just 0.4 per cent next year \u2013 half the level projected by Paris \u2013 the IMF said the outlook was further clouded by France\u2019s \u201csignificant loss of competitiveness\u201d. <\/p><p>\u201c[It] could become more serious if the French economy does not adapt at the same pace as its principal commercial partners, notably Italy and Spain, which, after Germany, are engaged in profound reforms of their labour and service markets,\u201d the IMF said.<\/p><p>The warning coincided with the release of a much-anticipated report by Louis Gallois, former chief executive of aerospace group EADS, who made what he called a \u201csevere diagnosis of the decline of French industry\u201d.<\/p><p>His report, commissioned by Mr Hollande, said the Socialist government should cut \u20ac30bn or 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product in social welfare costs on labour within two years to \u201cstop the decoupling\u201d of the French economy from its competitors.<\/p><p>Mr Gallois put the proposal at the centre of his recommendations despite strong signals from ministers that they were reluctant to take such drastic action. \u201cIt is what I call a competitiveness shock \u2013 a shock of confidence\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009[to] stop the slide and support investment\u201d, he said.<\/p><p>Mr Hollande, attending an Asian-European summit in Laos, said \u201cstrong decisions will be taken\u201d.

However, US companies sent a message of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d during the electoral limbo. No chief executive wants to wake up on Wednesday to a rerun of the post-poll squabbles of 2000, but, at the end of another close-fought US presidential campaign, companies remain largely untroubled by the party-political ebb and flow.<\/p><p>Multinationals have a geographical footprint larger than individual governments\u2019; they can track gradual ideological shifts easily \u2013 at least in developed democracies; and while financial targets and leadership tenure are ever shorter, their timescales are still longer than those of elected presidents.<\/p><p>As Rex Tillerson, ExxonMobil\u2019s chief executive, told the New York Times a few weeks before the last presidential election: \u201cThe reason the US has never had an energy policy is because an energy policy needs to be left alone for 15 to 20 years to take effect. But our policy makers want a two-year energy policy to fit with the election cycle because that is what people want.\u201d<\/p><p>Such businesses continue to pour resources into lobbying because having a voice in Washington \u2013 or Brussels, or Beijing \u2013 makes sense defensively. But they are also powerful \u201cpolitical actors\u201d, says Steve Coll, author of the 2012 FT business book of the year Private Empire, a study of Exxon and its influence. I question, however, whether the traditional, rigid, unilateral stance of a company such as Exxon is best-suited to modern, nuanced, multilateral geopolitical reality.<\/p><p>The unwritten rule in the US is that companies spread political funding between parties. Most hedge their bets, positioning themselves \u201cas friends to all responsible leaders, irrespective of political or ideological leaning\u201d, says Mr Coll. In this election cycle, Big Oil has become more partisan, but historically, Exxon\u2019s data-driven method of deciding where to direct political funds produced an outcome that was heavily skewed to the right compared with most other US companies: \u201cDow [Chemical] and Walmart \u2013 companies I think of as having pretty conservative interests \u2013 they are 50-50 [Republican-Democrat]. Exxon is 90-10.\u201d<\/p><p>Exxon\u2019s approach fits with its top-down management system, by which the company sets out how to handle everything from lobbying, to refinery construction, to human rights. But what is a strength in some areas \u2013 the company has an excellent safety record within its industry, for instance \u2013 must surely be a liability in others. When it comes to competing for new recruits, say, Mr Coll believes Exxon\u2019s formulaic and unbending culture could stifle the \u201cfreethinking, diverse, talented people\u201d the group will need to hire in order to compete with rivals.<\/p><p>It could also put it at a commercial disadvantage in the shifting environment where multinationals must now operate. Scarred by the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, the US company has judged that drilling in Alaska poses political risks (to quote Private Empire) \u201ccomparable to west Africa\u201d. Rival Royal Dutch Shell has chosen to grapple with the political and environmental controversies that operating in the region arouses. To date, Shell\u2019s approach has yielded little but protest, but it has explicitly adopted a different style.<\/p><p>Coincidentally, the speaker at the FT book award dinner last week was Jorma Ollila, Shell\u2019s chairman and also one of the judges.

Passenger numbers were up 7 per cent year on year. But the Irish carrier also pushed through fare increases averaging 6 per cent. Better still, ancillary revenues rose by a fifth to \u20ac585m, largely thanks to some passengers\u2019 willingness to pay for reserved seats or priority boarding. The result: an impressive 7 per cent yield increase. The cost side, meanwhile, was kept commendably tight: aside from a 24 per cent fuel bill jump, to \u20ac1.1bn, unit costs rose just 2 per cent.<\/p><p>Can Ryanair keep this up? With legacy carriers such as Lufthansa and Air France-KLM restructuring, survival issues hanging over some smaller European airlines, and the low-cost carrier itself grounding 80 aircraft again this winter, the short-term answer should be yes. Whether Ryanair\u2019s long-term target of 50 per cent growth in passengers and market share in the next decade can be achieved is harder to assess \u2013 although betting against the carrier has rarely been wise.<\/p><p>But the key question for investors is whether Ryanair is now the best place to put their money given current sector dynamics. Its shares, up 6 per cent on Monday, trade on 15 times 2012-13 consensus earnings and 13 times the 2013-14 figure. EasyJet, which stands to gain from the same trends, is on 10 times consensus earnings for 2012-13. Ryanair\u2019s record and strong balance sheet deserve a premium.

Blinking as they emerge into the light, three one-act ballets \u2013 recent creations made (as it were) on the premises \u2013 arrive on the Covent Garden stage, and are greeted by an enthusiastic public. And not a swan\u2019s feather, not a snowflake in sight. So Royal Ballet\u2019s new triple bill, all about dancing, denied most of the tra-la-la that usually attends its upholstered full-evening ventures, and on offer at bargain prices.  I have doubts about one work, but the chance to see our national ballet shaping its future, with the cream of its dancers on stage, is irresistible. <\/p><p>The programme is a fascination, even if its two novelties are second-hand: Liam Scarlett made his Viscera for the Miami City Ballet last year, using Lowell Liebermann\u2019s piano concerto as score; Christopher Wheeldon created his Fool\u2019s Paradise for his Morphoses troupe in 2007 to Joby Talbot music. But both are sprung from the Royal Ballet\u2019s ethos, and both speak to the company\u2019s dancers and to the company\u2019s identity. They are at home on the Royal Opera House stage. The third part of the evening is Wayne McGregor\u2019s Infra, which strikes me as entirely alien. Its cast is splendid, albeit deformed by McGregor\u2019s manner. <\/p><p>Viscera shows Scarlett\u2019s young, impressive talent responding with an unfailing elegance to Liebermann\u2019s writing. Design is stripped to the bone; dance springs from the stage as lines and energies form and change, and in the spare slow movement, choreography responds to each note with an austere, persuasive clarity. We see the music. <\/p><p>Wheeldon\u2019s Fool\u2019s Paradise is allusive, curious, offering hints and sideways glances at feeling and identity, choreography holding its cards close to its chest and then suddenly revealing penetrating insights into relationships. As with Viscera, performances are splendid: the dancing of Laura Morera, Marianela N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Ryoichi Hirano, Sarah Lamb, Melissa Hamilton, Edward Watson, Steven McRae and their colleagues throughout the evening is impeccable. A significant event, marking the new directorate of Kevin O\u2019Hare with the Royal Ballet. \u201cBallets,\u201d someone should write in big letters in the rehearsal studios, \u201care about dancing\u201d. <\/p>"},{"id":"33721471","uuid":"1c58706e-272e-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0","title":"Animal Collective, The Roundhouse, London","catid":"336","byline":"By Richard Clayton","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 17:35:56 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/2\/1c58706e-272e-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"The experimental Baltimore band generated some extraordinary psychedelic sounds, writes Richard Clayton","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Music"},"share":{"webappemail":"PRR7Hh","webappshare":"VuAtyA"},"image":true,"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 17:35:56 +0000","content":"<p>Have you ever been experienced?

It\u2019s commonplace to describe them as a jam band, but their playing seemed full of deliberation, anchored by Panda Bear\u2019s furiously controlled drumming. His sugary vocals, and Avey Tare\u2019s screamier variety, provided the melodic threads that guided us through the sonic melee.

Now, according to official blurb, it \u201ccreates and launches new and innovative works that inspire, entertain and reflect our diverse community\u201d.<\/p><p>The current vehicle (until November 11) is The Medium, an unabashedly theatrical, shamelessly tawdry melodrama written by Gian Carlo Menotti in 1946. Despite lofty pretensions, it remains little more than a schlocky horror show. Still, it is carefully crafted and, by the composer\u2019s standards, gratifyingly concise.<\/p><p>The central character, Madame Flora, aka Baba, makes her boozy living running trick s\u00e9ances for innocents desperate to communicate with their dearly departed. Eventually, however, she is reduced to a not-so-Grand Guignol hysteric, undone by her own illusions and delusions.<\/p><p>Over the decades the role has proved a rewarding vehicle for extrovert singing-actresses such as Claramae Turner, who created it, Marie Powers, who played it on Broadway and on film, and Regina Resnik, who scored a personal triumph with it in Washington.

One had to question the validity, however, of making him a sophisticated fiddler, vibrato master in excelsis, rather than Menotti\u2019s tambourine-toying primitive.

The BBC Symphony Orchestra\u2019s homage was well deserved and brilliantly executed under Knussen\u2019s baton, but it did not remove questions over his wider reputation. Like Ravel, whose music it sometimes echoes, Knussen\u2019s output is small and perfectly formed. Behind this generality, the BBCSO\u2019s programme fuelled suspicions that he has spent too much creative energy drawing from past models, and that the emphases of his music \u2013 craftsmanlike polish, consonant sonority, neatly camouflaged structural orthodoxy \u2013 now come across as old-fashioned. None of Knussen\u2019s successors, for example, would dream of labelling a work with the word \u201csymphony\u201d, as he has done.<\/p><p>On their own terms, Two Organa and the Horn Concerto (Martin Owen, flawless) seduced the ear with the siren sounds of Knussen\u2019s orchestral palette. But heard together like this, the family resemblance was a little too obvious \u2013 as if his ambitions and motivations as a composer had somewhere ground to a halt. There is also the question of scale. Why is it that Knussen\u2019s ideas never develop a more extended life? While recognising that he doesn\u2019t waste a note or outstay his welcome, it seems a pity that he remains wedded to the miniature.<\/p><p>His finesse was exemplified by the Requiem \u2013 Songs for Sue, in a performance dedicated to the memory of Hans Werner Henze and radiantly sung by Claire Booth. She gave an equally translucent account of the Whitman Settings, which sounded far more palatable in this sumptuous orchestral version than in the original for voice and piano.<\/p><p>The most challenging music was confined to the instrumental pieces heard in an early evening recital at the Guildhall School \u2013 notably Autumnal for violin and piano (Alexandra Wood and Huw Watkins) and Variations for piano (Ryan Wigglesworth), both of which came across as a little too sophisticated for their own good.

The fun is in the shocked reaction from American liberals \u2013 and virtually all Europeans \u2013 who find the very thought of a Republican victory utterly horrifying. Even suggesting that a Romney presidency might be tolerable feels like telling Roman citizens that Alaric the Visigoth has been unfairly traduced.<\/p><p>If I could vote, I would \u2013 like almost everybody else in Europe \u2013 cast my ballot for Barack Obama. He was dealt a very difficult hand and he has played it reasonably well. I approve of his effort to provide universal healthcare coverage \u2013 even though the reform itself is a mess. Making the tax system more redistributive seems reasonable, given the rise in inequality. I prefer his approach to the outside world and to social issues, such as abortion. And, since I was never inspired by his \u201chope and change\u201d stuff in 2008 (on the contrary), I am not disillusioned it has not worked out.<\/p><p>Where I depart from the liberal consensus is that I think that Mr Romney would be a perfectly decent president.<\/p><p>Working out what kind of a president the Republican would be is, admittedly, not very easy. He has turned so many somersaults during the course of the election that nobody can be certain which incarnation would report for work in the Oval Office. Would it be moderate Mitt or \u201cseverely conservative\u201d Romney?<\/p><p>On domestic policy, Mr Romney has promised both to dismantle Mr Obama\u2019s healthcare reform and to preserve its key features. He has promised both a massive tax cut and to get serious about balancing the budget. (This circle to be squared through the removal of unspecified tax breaks). When it comes to foreign policy, he has sometimes been a tough-talking neoconservative. At other times, particularly during the last debate, he has sounded like Obama II.<\/p><p>Even looking at Mr Romney\u2019s advisers is not much of a clue. Inevitably, his team represents an effort to build coalitions and touch bases within the Republican party. So, on foreign policy, Mr Romney has flirted with nationalistic paleo-cons such as John Bolton. But the man he appointed to oversee his foreign policy transition team was Robert Zoellick, who is a moderate, serious-minded internationalist with vast experience. That is a hopeful sign \u2013 but not much more, since the true balance of power within the Romney team has yet to emerge.<\/p><p>Since neither Mr Romney\u2019s statements nor his advisers provide a clear guide to what sort of president he would be, we are left with three things to go on: his abilities, his character and his record. And here the evidence is encouraging.<\/p><p>The Republican candidate is clearly a very able man. Whatever you think of private equity, it is a very competitive business \u2013 and Mr Romney rose to the top. He was a competent governor of Massachusetts. Among the bizarre collection of candidates that fought for the Republican nomination, Mr Romney was clearly the most able \u2013 with the possible exception of Jon Huntsman. And, unlike Mr Huntsman, he showed a ruthless willingness to say and do what it took to win the nomination.<\/p><p>My guess is that the \u201creal Romney\u201d (assuming such a thing exists) is a moderate. His background in business and his record as a governor do not suggest that he is a fire-breathing social conservative. On the contrary, he comes across as a traditional boardroom Republican. That is certainly how he is perceived within his own party \u2013 where the genuinely severe conservatives have long regarded their presidential candidate with suspicion.<\/p><p>The peculiar nature of the modern Republican party, rather than the candidate himself, is the main reason for worrying about a Romney presidency. If he were to indulge the worst instincts of his party, a President Romney would cut up America\u2019s social safety net, push on with a reactionary social agenda and recommit to a highly militarised foreign policy that would end up with yet another war in the Middle East \u2013 this time with Iran.<\/p><p>Some American liberals fear that the Republicans in Congress would drag Mr Romney towards this radical agenda. Yet the probability is that at least one half of Congress will remain in Democratic hands. And, as Mr Obama has discovered, it is very hard for a president to get much done when faced with a recalcitrant Capitol Hill. If he wanted to govern effectively, Mr Romney would have to be the dealmaker from Bain \u2013 not the Tea Party radical.<\/p><p>On foreign policy, the Republican candidate has offered various hostages to fortune. He might well give the green light for an Israeli attack on Iran. Frankly, however, even Mr Obama might end up doing that. Mr Romney has talked tough on Russia and has promised to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office. Since it would be awkward to break a campaign promise on day one, he would probably have to do that. Yet \u2013 whatever the impression he has sought to give to the voters of Ohio \u2013 such a decision would not automatically lead to tariffs.<\/p><p>Finally, there is the question of character. Mr Romney\u2019s record as a candidate suggests that he is a cold fish, without many fixed principles. These are not attractive qualities in a human being. But they would be useful qualities in a president.<\/p><p><a onclick=\"if (mFT.mailto) return mFT.mailto('gideon.rachman@ft.com')\" href=\"mailto:gideon.rachman@ft.com\">gideon.rachman@ft.com<\/a><\/p>"},{"id":"33721531","uuid":"501770de-2739-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0","title":"Britain and Germany are growing apart","catid":"9","byline":"By Janan Ganesh","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 17:29:34 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/501770de-2739-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"Berlin feels it can manage without British support and is increasingly reluctant to tolerate Tory intransigence on Europe, writes Janan Ganesh","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Columnists"},"share":{"webappemail":"StJKSe","webappshare":"VuzK0b"},"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 17:29:34 +0000","content":"<p>Whoever wins the US presidential election, David Cameron will host the true star of the current crop of western leaders in Downing Street on Wednesday. Angela Merkel has approval ratings that put his \u2013 as well as Barack Obama\u2019s and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s \u2013 to shame. This is despite holding office for longer than all three men put together. She presides over a prosperous Germany with an official capital that doubles up, as my colleague Gideon Rachman recently argued, as the unofficial capital of the EU. She can be confident of re-election next year, even if she has to trade in her liberal coalition partners for the Social Democrats.<\/p><p>All this reflects well on her but the ultimate proof that Germany is well led is that when the country behaves \u201cnormally\u201d \u2013 that is, in its own interests \u2013 it really does seem normal. There is little anxiety or self-reproach in Germany when Ms Merkel prescribes fiscal rectitude for southern Europe, effortlessly outmatches France for control of the EU agenda or, indeed, radiates impatience with the UK. The last of these is not lost on Whitehall. The UK and Germany, allies of a sort on big EU matters, are growing apart.<\/p><p>Froideur descended last year when Mr Cameron challenged Germany\u2019s purist take on central banking by suggesting that the European Central Bank provide more direct help to troubled eurozone members. The temperature dropped further when he vetoed a fiscal pact largely designed in Berlin. Things are, if anything, even icier this year as the two countries squabble over the EU budget. The fact that it was Germany, not France, which scuppered the proposed merger of the UK\u2019s BAE Systems and the pan-European EADS was grimly telling.<\/p><p>In the EU\u2019s internal politics, the Anglo-German relationship has never been as deep as the Franco-German one. It was an improvised answer to the Gaullist vision of Europe. Where France pushed for protectionism and heavy regulation, the UK and Germany made common cause on behalf of trade and a competitive internal market. When Paris sought to define European foreign policy against the US, London and Berlin preserved the Atlantic relationship. But this alliance of convenience makes less sense at a time of French weakness. Germany still prizes the UK as a counterweight to dirigisme, and frets that the ideological centre ground of the 17-member eurozone is some way to the left of the EU generally, but it now feels strong enough to win most arguments without British help. It is therefore less willing to tolerate Mr Cameron\u2019s perceived intransigence on other matters, including the budget.<\/p><p>But there is more to Anglo-German estrangement than impersonal shifts in Europe\u2019s underlying balance of power. It is difficult to overstate how different British Conservatives have become from German Christian Democrats. The Tories once had a mighty left flank of politicians who could have belonged to Ms Merkel\u2019s party. The likes of Michael Heseltine, Chris Patten and Ken Clarke were committed to the two great orthodoxies of postwar politics: the welfare state and European integration. The party is now younger and overwhelmingly free-market and eurosceptic. many of the 2010 parliamentary intake are classical liberals or even libertarians. They do not resent the EU as an affront to their national pride \u2013 the kind of grievance that a CDU politician could at least understand in principle \u2013 but as a bureaucratic fetter on a free economy.<\/p><p>They admire many aspects of Germany\u2019s economic model: its fiscal prudence, its export industries, the supply-side reforms undertaken by Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, Ms Merkel\u2019s Social Democrat predecessor. But they want to emulate these in order to make the UK the ultimate global trader, not merely the most competitive bit of the EU. Mr Cameron\u2019s decision to withdraw his MEPs from the main conservative caucus in the European parliament diminished UK influence, but it was intellectually honest. There really is very little in common between the Tories and the other big centre-right parties on the continent.<\/p><p>A relationship is truly fraying when the interlocutors not only disagree on specific matters but barely understand each other. The British struggle to grasp that Germany will do almost anything to preserve the euro, even at its own economic cost. Ministers have long believed that Ms Merkel would sooner turn her back on the eurozone\u2019s periphery than underwrite the currency with German money or compromise its view of how the ECB should operate. Only recently have they shed this delusion.<\/p><p>The Germans, for their part, still regard euroscepticism as the particular whim of a few Tory MPs rather than the settled will of the British electorate. In candid remarks in Berlin last month, William Hague, the foreign secretary, said that his compatriots\u2019 hostility to the EU is the \u201cdeepest it has ever been\u201d. Show leadership, Ms Merkel might implore. But even she would struggle to defy public opinion indefinitely. She may glower over the table on Wednesday, but her host is as moderate on Europe as any British prime minister could feasibly be right now.<\/p><p><a onclick=\"if (mFT.mailto) return mFT.mailto('janan.ganesh@ft.com')\" href=\"mailto:janan.ganesh@ft.com\">janan.ganesh@ft.com<\/a><\/p>"},{"id":"33721551","uuid":"82c53822-2739-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0","title":"US must wait for the Great Realignment","catid":"171","byline":"By Francis\u2009Fukuyama","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 17:39:58 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/82c53822-2739-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"Surveys indicate the American people are much less polarised than the political class that claims to represent them, writes Francis Fukuyama","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Opinion"},"share":{"webappemail":"StJKSk","webappshare":"StJIcZ"},"storypackage":[{"articleid":"33721721","title":"US industrial commons"},{"articleid":"33722971","title":"US election \u2013 winning trades"},{"articleid":"33721521","title":"A Romney presidency would be just fine"}]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 17:39:58 +0000","content":"<p>Many pundits are telling Americans that they face a historic choice on election day, between an America that will increasingly resemble a European social democracy, or one that will return to its limited government, individualistic roots. This is nonsense. Since the House will probably remain Republican and the Senate Democrat, the system of checks and balances will ensure that the paralysis that has gripped the country over the past four years will continue for the next four, regardless of whether Barack Obama or Mitt Romney wins. It would be nice if the US actually made up its mind as to what kind of government it wanted, but it is very unlikely that today\u2019s election will resolve this issue. <\/p><p>Both parties have been yearning for a \u201crealigning\u201d election, such as those of 1896, which brought William McKinley and the Republicans into control of the presidency and both houses of Congress, or the 1932 election that did the same for the Democrats. Mr Obama believed his election in 2008 gave him that sort of mandate, an understandable mistake given the financial crisis unfolding at that time. But he won only because swing voters were fed up with George W. Bush. While he succeeded in pushing through a large stimulus and the Affordable Care Act, he discovered that he could not command durable support for a progressive agenda, and was repudiated in the 2010 midterms.<\/p><p>The Republicans are hoping for a realignment in the other direction \u2013 hence the view in conservative circles that the polls are biased against them, and that there will be a blowout in their favour when the American people finally speak. During the mid-2000s, Karl Rove dreamt of a \u201cpermanent Republican majority\u201d. What is remarkable, however, is how evenly matched the candidates are. The winner will be decided by a coin toss, or some fluke of electoral college arithmetic. A decisive swing to either Left or Right is virtually certain not to happen.<\/p><p>A key question is whether the 50-50 divide represents a deep polarisation in American society, or whether it is a byproduct of a dysfunctional political system that amplifies rather than moderates ruptures. It is clear that the extremes have pulled further apart. This is largely due to the rightward shift of the Republican party, parts of which now want to turn the clock back not just to before the New Deal, but to the period before the progressive era. In response, the Democrats have dug in their heels to defend existing welfare state entitlements such as Medicare. <\/p><p>There still remains a group of centrist voters who want leaders actually to govern the country rather than disparage one another. During the debates, Mr Romney turned into a moderate Republican vowing to defend Medicare and not lower taxes on the rich because he was forced to appeal to swing state voters, rather than to party ideologues as in the primaries. The political scientist Morris Fiorina has argued for some time that survey data indicate the American people are much less polarised than the broader political class that purports to represent them. <\/p><p>Our political institutions clearly make a bad situation much worse. Congress is far more polarised than the public at large, with the most liberal Republican standing to the right of the most conservative Democrat. Our system of checks and balances offers many opportunities for strongly partisan minorities to block outcomes they don\u2019t like, without having to come up with realistic alternatives. The result last year was the stalemate over raising the debt ceiling; it will soon be a crisis over avoiding the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d. <\/p><p>A well-functioning political system should seek to mitigate polarisation rather than to exacerbate it. So beyond the immediate policy agendas, there is a range of institutional reforms the country needs to consider that would reduce the veto power of groups at the extremes and force more consensual decision-making. Ending the parties\u2019 political control of district boundaries is one obvious measure. Creating a streamlined budget process with a single up-or-down vote, giving less scope for lobbyists, would be another. Forcing Congress to be more deliberative by shielding it from continuous public scrutiny might also help. The public sector would become more efficient if it were protected from Congressional micromanagement that turns every decision into a political football.<\/p><p>Like the Messiah, the Great Realignment is not likely to arrive soon. In the meantime, we need to work with what we\u2019ve got, and try to turn a 50-50 split into something more like a 25-50-25 distribution. <\/p><p> The writer is a senior fellow at Stanford\u2019s Freeman Spogli Institute<\/p>"},{"id":"33721561","uuid":"b780f47c-2750-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0","title":"HSBC \u2013 doubling up","catid":"68","byline":"","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 17:40:13 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/3\/b780f47c-2750-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"The bank has more than doubled its provision for a US money laundering fine, which clouds the investment case \u2013 but the underlying business is encouraging","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Lex"},"share":{"webappemail":"TFYmAV","webappshare":"StJFhw"},"stocks":{"uk:HSBA":"HSBC Holdings PLC","uk:STAN":"Standard Chartered PLC","uk:BARC":"Barclays PLC"},"storypackage":[{"articleid":"33721361","title":"Buoyant HSBC shrugs off PPI setback"},{"articleid":"33720671","title":"Fear HSBC\u2019s penalties could top $2bn"},{"articleid":"33721051","title":"\u2018Beano\u2019 Levene \/ HSBC \/ FastJet"}]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 17:40:13 +0000","content":"<p>Another day, another big provision from a UK-based bank for past misdemeanours. This time the culprit is HSBC, with an additional $1.1bn set aside, $800m of which relates to a forthcoming settlement with US authorities over money laundering. It is tempting to sweep this, along with the cost of mis-sold payment protection insurance, under the carpet. After all, the total for both issues is \u00a32.2bn, or 12p per share, making only a small dent in the 619p share price. But what is troubling about the money laundering allegation is that $700m had been set aside for it in July. The cost has more than doubled in three months and there could be more to come. Uncertainty rarely goes down well. <\/p><p>HSBC\u2019s saving grace is that its global spread offers diversification from the fine-hungry regulators and moribund economies of Europe and the US. Monday\u2019s results for the first nine months offered some proof. The loan book grew 6 per cent, while underlying profits were up 21 per cent thanks to falling US impairment charges. Basel III core tier one capital is comfortable at more than 10 per cent, so HSBC can keep lending while rivals cut back.<\/p><p>But, for all its emerging markets lustre, just under half of HSBC\u2019s loan book is in Europe, with a further 16 per cent in the US. The bank makes much of its shift to quality, replacing risky lending such as credit cards with more secure (albeit lower margin) products such as mortgages. But the result is that net income \u2013 before impairments \u2013 is falling in Europe and flat in the US. <\/p><p>Operationally, HSBC is in a better position than most of its peers and deserves its premium stock market rating of 1.2 times book value. But from a regulatory point of view it is with the likes of Barclays and Standard Chartered in facing a nasty combination of fines and rule changes.

Although subsidies have been cut in recent years, some have increasingly been skewed towards trying to build up domestic industries. Earlier this year the US announced anti-subsidy tariffs on imports of solar cells from China \u2013 with the EU contemplating similar action \u2013 a decision Beijing has also challenged at the WTO.<\/p><p>Trina Solar, one of the Chinese solar manufacturing exporters targeted in the EU investigation, has noted the difficulty of applying trade rules to complex renewable energy programmes. \u201cMany governments give support \u2013 it\u2019s a question of what are the details, and is it OK?\u201d says Jodie Roussell, Trina Solar\u2019s director of European public affairs. \u201c[Is] a feed-in tariff an incentive or a subsidy?

As voters go to the polls on Tuesday, the outcome of the election is still uncertain. But the one thing that is crystal clear, against the backdrop of a desperately close result, is that Tuesday\u2019s vote will be the most expensive election in American history; indeed, it is the most costly vote, in absolute terms, ever seen anywhere in the world.<\/p><p>According to the Center for Responsive Politics, for example, about $2.5bn has been spent in recent months on campaigns for the presidential election. However, when the congressional battles are included, the tally rises to almost $6bn. That is double the amount spent in 2000, and 7 per cent up from 2008. <\/p><p>It is also starkly higher than other western nations. Last year, for example, Canada held a general election, and the bill was a \u201cmere\u201d C$291m, or C$8 a head. And when the UK held its general election in 2010, this was estimated to cost some \u00a349m, or a mere 50p a head. The US election, however, equates to about $18 a head, for every man, woman and (non-voting) child.<\/p><p>So is this $6bn price tag justified? Some Americans would argue so. After all, the issues at stake in Tuesday\u2019s vote are vitally important, given the state of the economy. Moreover, America is a country which prides itself on being a beacon of free speech, political debate and voter engagement and outreach.<\/p><p>And if you compare that $6bn bill against some of the other things that Americans are currently spend their cash on, the election outlay starts to look a bit less extraordinary. This year, for example, American households will spend a projected $7bn on potato chips, and last month alone they splashed out about $8bn on Halloween festivities. Meanwhile, the US government has recently been spending just over $6bn each month on its operations in Afghanistan; and during the height of the financial crisis, the US Treasury provided a $6bn loan to just one company, namely GMAC, the car finance group.<\/p><p>Nevertheless, what really provokes unease among many American voters \u2013 and shock among non-Americans \u2013 is not so much the absolute $6bn price tag but how the money is being raised and spent. Until recently, it was relatively easy for groups such as the Center for Responsive Politics to track election cash flows, since American laws mandated high levels of disclosure.<\/p><p>But a Supreme Court ruling in early 2010 permitted the creation of \u201csuper-Pacs\u201d, which can raise and spend money with far less transparency. At least $750m of funds is thought to have flowed through these groups in recent months (although nobody is entirely sure.) It appears that those shadowy funds have been funnelled into closely fought races in places such as Ohio and contributed a dramatic increase in the volume of negative, targeted advertising.<\/p><p>Surveys suggest that many voters hate this: About 80 per cent of Americans tell voters that they disapprove of the 2010 campaign finance ruling and almost as many say they hate negative advertisements too. And what is adding to the unease is that this rise in super-Pac spending is occurring amid growing income inequality too; rightly or wrongly, this has created the popular impression that the infamous \u201cone per cent\u201d of ultra wealthy Americans are buying political influence to a growing degree. <\/p><p>But do not bet on seeing change soon. After all, a nation which is as deeply \u2013 and evenly \u2013 divided as America is also a place where both Democrats and Republicans have every incentive to keep engaging in a campaign arms race. Whatever happens on Tuesday, in other words, the one thing that can be predicted with ease is that when America goes to vote in 2016, the next price tag could be bigger still. <\/p>"},{"id":"33721611","uuid":null,"title":"Turkey\u2019s upgrade: the $100bn question","catid":"491","byline":"Daniel Dombey","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 18:02:30 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/blogs.ft.com\/beyond-brics\/2012\/11\/05\/turkeys-upgrade-the-100bn-question","snip":"For years, in fact since Moody&#8217;s Investors Service downgraded Turkey from investment grade 1994, Turkish officials and financiers have been hoping to regain the rating.","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":null},"share":{"webappemail":"StUlMY","webappshare":"RMuH52"},"protectionlevel":"free"},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 18:02:30 +0000","content":"<p><a onclick=\"if (mFT.openExternal) return mFT.openExternal(this)\" href=\"http:\/\/blogs.r.ftdata.co.uk\/beyond-brics\/files\/2012\/11\/136313700.jpg\"><img class=\"inline-article-image\" onerror=\"this.style.visibility='hidden'\" src=\"http:\/\/blogs.r.ftdata.co.uk\/beyond-brics\/files\/2012\/11\/136313700-167x117.jpg\"167\" data-orig-height=\"117\" \/><\/a>For years, in fact since Moody&#8217;s Investors Service downgraded Turkey from investment grade 1994, Turkish officials and financiers have been hoping to regain the rating.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On Monday, Fitch gave them their wish, with a BBB- rating.

Ed Parker, Fitch managing director, emphasises the country&#8217;s rebalancing away from its previous domestic demand-led growth model.<\/p><p>He is unfazed by arguments that exports this year have been (perhaps unsustainably) boosted by net gold sales of more than $5.5bn, mainly to Iran, arguing that the underlying rebalancing story is still impressive, with the current account deficit coming down to an expected $58bn this year, from $78bn in 2011.<\/p><p>Nor is he worried by the impact on the deficit of revived domestic demand, given that government growth expectations are relatively modest &#8211; Ankara predicts 3.2 per cent growth this year, 4 per cent in 2013 and 5 per cent for the next two years after that.<\/p><p>&#8220;Turkey still can have domestic demand growth without the current account deficit increasing,&#8221; he says.<\/p><p>Still, concern has already been sounded from one quarter. A note on upgrades throughout the world from 1990 to 2011 remarks on a number of phenomena that Turkey might want to prepare for, just in case. Here&#8217;s an extract:<\/p><blockquote><p>While cost of external debt falls significantly following the upgrade, the average maturity of debt does not portray a significant change&#8230; Domestic currency appreciates significantly&#8230; both before and after the upgrade. Total external debt, which formerly declines mostly due to reduction in public debt, displays an upward trend in the post-upgrade period. Meanwhile, current account deteriorates in most of the cases&#8230; Finally, despite higher post-upgrade absolute growth rates, relative growth performances in pre- and post-upgrade periods do not differ statistically significantly.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The source of this bucket of cold water? <a onclick=\"if (mFT.openExternal) return mFT.openExternal(this)\" href=\"http:\/\/www.tcmb.gov.tr\/research\/ekonominotlari\/2012\/eng\/EN1225eng.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The Turkish central bank<\/a>.<\/p><p><strong>Related reading:<\/strong><a title=\"Fitch raises Turkey to investment grade\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/9e2c38dc-2742-11e2-9863-00144feabdc0.html\"><br \/>Fitch raises Turkey to investment grade<\/a>, FT<\/p>","protectionlevel":"free"},{"id":"33721621","uuid":"a585856a-2694-11e2-9109-00144feabdc0","title":"Healthcare dispute hits Dutch coalition","catid":"75","byline":"By Matt Steinglass in Amsterdam","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 18:02:02 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/a585856a-2694-11e2-9109-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"New government is sworn in amid a dispute over concessions the Liberal prime minister granted Labour in the coalition agreement","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Europe"},"share":{"webappemail":"StUksg","webappshare":"QisH9H"},"storypackage":[{"articleid":"33721891","title":"Dutch finance minister set for lead role"}]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 18:02:02 +0000","content":"<p>The Netherlands' new centrist government was supposed to usher in a period of calm, after two years of bitter left-right conflict over austerity policies and eurozone crisis measures.<\/p><p>But the coalition of centre-right Liberals of Mark Rutte, prime minister, and the centre-left Labour party led by Diederik Samsom looks anything but peaceful. Even as it was sworn in on Monday, the new government faced an unexpected row that threatens to poison their collaboration before it gets started.<\/p><p>Liberal backbenchers and voters have rebelled against concessions Mr Rutte granted Labour in the coalition agreement \u2013 particularly a deal to make health insurance premiums dependent on income, which could cost higher earners thousands of euros annually.<\/p><p>Local Liberal leaders laid into Mr Rutte at a party congress on Friday demanding explanations for their constituents, while the right-leaning Telegraaf, the country\u2019s largest paper, dubbed the prime minister \u201cMarx Rutte\u201d.<\/p><p>Mr Rutte has assured his voters that the deal can still be adjusted, but Mr Samsom has declined to go along, insisting that \u201cthe accord remains as we agreed to it\u201d.<\/p><p>If the parties cannot settle the dispute, it will undermine the prospects for a government that many had hoped could use its solid parliamentary majority to make crucial, politically painful reforms, both domestically and in Europe.<\/p><p>The tension erupted over a plan for progressive health-insurance premiums that many economists say was botched.<\/p><p>Under the Netherlands\u2019 current system, residents must buy policies from competing private insurers at an average price of \u20ac1,270 a year, with low-income earners receiving a subsidy.<\/p><p>The new accord would change the premium into a tax of 11 per cent, up to double the median Dutch income \u2013 about \u20ac70,000 a year.<\/p><p>The tax would be partly compensated for by cuts in income tax, including a cut in the top rate from 52 to 49 per cent. But because the health insurance tax is capped, many earners between \u20ac50,000 and \u20ac70,000 a year will see overall annual tax rises of \u20ac1,000 or more, while wealthy earners over \u20ac128,000 a year will come out ahead.<\/p><p>\u201cFor the higher middle incomes, they are suddenly facing prohibitively high marginal tax rates,\u201d said Arnoud Boot, a finance professor at the University of Amsterdam. \u201cThis is not a credible way to do healthcare policy.\u201d<\/p><p>In addition, critics say, by cutting payments for low earners to as little as \u20ac20 a month, the tax undermines the purpose of the premiums, which is to create competition between insurers.<\/p><p>Liberal voters are furious, with pollster Maurice de Hond reporting on Friday that a majority now thinks the party lied to its voters during the election campaign. <\/p><p>Many analysts expect Labour will find a way to mitigate the tax rise in order to let Mr Rutte save face with his party and avoid crippling the new coalition.<\/p><p>But neither Mr Samsom nor Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the new Labour finance minister, who together made up Labour\u2019s team in the coalition negotiations, have shown any willingness to compromise.<\/p><p>At Labour's party congress on Saturday, which approved the coalition agreement, the mood did not appear conciliatory.<\/p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing it with the blues [the Liberals], but we\u2019re not turning purple,\u201d Labour party chairman Hans Spekman told the audience. \u201cWe\u2019re staying as red as can be.\u201d<\/p>"},{"id":"33721631","uuid":"7e00b3fc-2766-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0","title":"Chile\u2019s Golborne to seek presidency","catid":"22","byline":"By Jude Webber in Buenos Aires","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 23:49:30 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/7e00b3fc-2766-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"Charismatic public works minister captured Chilean hearts as mining minister in 2010 for his empathetic handling of the rescue of 33 trapped miners","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Americas Politics & Policy"},"share":{"webappemail":"PRXJoW","webappshare":"QisH9K"},"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 23:49:30 +0000","content":"<p>The most charismatic centre-right politician in Chile has finally confirmed what had long been expected: he will be a candidate in next year\u2019s presidential elections.<\/p><p>Laurence Golborne, the public works minister who captured Chilean hearts as mining minister for his empathetic handling of the rescue of 33 trapped miners in 2010, said he was ready to run against Michelle Bachelet, the popular former centre-left president who is the frontrunner for the November 17 2013 polls.<\/p><p>Calling for new faces, and criticising the government\u2019s focus on measuring Chile\u2019s progress towards becoming a developed country in purely economic terms, Mr Golborne told La Tercera newspaper in an interview: \u201cI am ready and available to face the challenge of competing for the chance to represent our sector in the 2013 presidential elections and I feel ready to beat the [centre-left coalition] Concertaci\u00f3n candidate.\u201d<\/p><p>He cast Ms Bachelet, who is currently head of UN Women, as a throwback to a past in a Chile that has changed.

We are going to see if we want renewal or to keep the same people who have been around for 20 years.\u201d<\/p><p>Ms Bachelet has not yet confirmed her candidacy but the Concertaci\u00f3n coalition, which governed from the return of democracy in 1990 until 2000, was given a boost by municipal elections last month in which it trounced Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era\u2019s ruling centre-right alliance.

As expected, Mr Golborne and Andr\u00e9s Allamand, defence minister, left to pursue their presidential aspirations.<\/p><p>Opinion polls suggest Mr Allamand is lagging a long way behind his former cabinet colleague. In an opinion survey in July-August by respected pollsters CEP, only 2 per cent of respondents wanted Mr Allamand to be the next president, against 9 per cent for Mr Golborne and 50 per cent for Ms Bachelet.<\/p><p>Mr Golborne, a political independent and former chief executive of successful Chilean retailer Cencosud, appeared already to be on the hustings, recounting his middle-class roots, how he travelled to school by bus and queued at the bakery and had worked his way up to get where he did. \u201cI think having lived through that I can help represent [opportunity] in a more concrete way.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cChile is a country that has changed. It has nothing to do with the Chile of 30 years ago,\u201d he added.<\/p><p>The centre-right is likely to hold a primary election between the two ministers, and Mr Golborne said the best way to do well was to connect with \u201cordinary people\u201d. In his own family, he said he had a communist sister and far-right brother, which he said made him able to \u201cvalue differences and practice tolerance\u201d.<\/p><p>Mr Pi\u00f1era\u2019s government says it wants to lay the foundations to make Chile a developed country by the end of the decade, but a serious controversy over poverty numbers has overshadowed its progress in tackling ingrained social problems.<\/p><p>Mr Golborne said the government\u2019s focus on measuring development in economic terms was \u201ca tremendous error\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009people don\u2019t just aspire to a higher GDP, but to a more humane and supportive society.

It is normal for a decade to pass between when an asset of someone charged with being part of an organised crime group is confiscated and the final court verdict that passes the assets definitively to the state. Often, as with the San Paolo, it then takes many more years before the government finds a buyer, while businesses languish or fold, leading to job losses and social unrest.<\/p><p>\u201cI have grown attached to the hotel but I shouldn\u2019t, because sooner or later the government will sell it and I will have to move on,\u201d says Mr Turchio, as he walks through the sprawling hotel with its sea views, an auditorium seating 900 and a rooftop pool with spectacular panoramic vistas of Palermo and the coast. <\/p><p>The more than 1,600 confiscated businesses in Italy include construction companies, healthcare providers, mines, castles, manufacturers, villas, vineyards, hotels and supermarkets: they all suffer from a lack of access to credit. However, there is a dearth of managers such as Mr Turchio with the skills to take on some unusually challenging situations.<\/p><p>To meet demand, a group of business schools and business associations this year launched a postgraduate course offering formal, practical training for would-be managers of ex-Mafia concerns. The course, which included visits to see Mr Turchio and the San Paolo, aims to train a cadre of experienced managers to be deployed across Italy.<\/p><p>\u201cWe need professional managers to come in not only to keep a business from closing but to develop it so we can demonstrate that when the state takes over from the Mafia, that doesn\u2019t mean job losses,\u201d says Marella Caramazza, director-general of Fondazione Istud, a business school located near Milan, which is leading the course along with two other business schools, Bocconi in Milan and Luiss in Rome. \u201cWe must show that when managed legally these can be profitable businesses that bring employment to the community.\u201d<\/p><p>Mafia-run businesses tend to be generous in handing out jobs locally to build consensus in the neighbourhood. Mr Turchio acknowledges that his 71 full-time employees are probably more than he needs, but only those who have been implicated in dealings with the Mafia have been dismissed.<\/p><p>Istud received 250 applications for the 63 places on the five-month course, which is funded by Aldai, an association representing managers in Lombardy, and Assolombarda, a regional employers\u2019 association. <\/p><p>\u201cThe chance to be able to contribute in some way to help these companies survive and flourish is very appealing and is why I applied,\u201d says Antonio Pardo, 49, a marketing and auditing consultant who took the course.<\/p><p>Twelve days of classroom work, with lecturers including an anti-Mafia magistrate from the organised-crime ridden Calabria region, were combined with 30 days visiting businesses. Mr Pardo says: \u201cWe have all read how money-laundering works, but with our on-site visits and case studies we were able to see first-hand how it takes place.\u201d<\/p><p>The students, ten of whom were female, studied the financial peculiarities of confiscated assets, such as unwinding Mafia contracts with suppliers and alternatives to the Mafia as sources of funding.<\/p><p>These were skills that Mr Turchio had to learn on the job.<\/p><p>\u201cI arrived at the door of the hotel with my briefcase and the court document showing I was in charge, and nobody here had any idea what to make of me,\u201d he says. He was 30 when he took over in 1994, just three years after the hotel had opened. \u201cI received some threats at the beginning, including people telling me to take my hands off their money, but on the whole I have not had any problems.\u201d <\/p><p>At first sight, the San Paolo resembles any of the other mid-range business hotels that dot cities from New York to Sydney. It has the same smiling receptionists, leather couches in the lobby and a local touch \u2013 in this case paintings of tuna fishing, a once-important local industry.<\/p><p>Yet the dated wood panelling and excessive use of mirrors evoke a bygone era, and with no credit lines to call on for remodelling, the San Paolo is showing its age. A record year for revenue in 2007 has been followed by steady declines.<\/p><p>Fifteen kilometres east in the town of Bagheria, Andrea Dara, another accountant working as a court-appointed administrator, has invested and turned the Villa Santa Teresa radiology and nuclear medicine clinic into a thriving business. This is thanks to a mortgage and a competent manager who took over as chief executive.<\/p><p>\u201cNot everybody appointed by the court is lucky to have a good manager so it is important to have trained managers who can come in with clear ideas,\u201d says Mr Dara, speaking in the shade of lemon trees outside the clinic. \u201cMy manager could leave and then what do I do if there aren\u2019t properly trained people ready to step in?\u201d <\/p><p>Like Mr Turchio, Mr Dara found he had too many employees when he took over. Estimating that 40 of the 120 staff were not needed for the jobs they had been hired to do, he paid for retraining, including for 11 drivers to become medical technicians.<\/p><p>Marcello Laccisaglia, another course participant, says he is ready to help Mr Dara and other administers, but is unsure whether he will get a chance. \u201cUntil there is a law mandating that a professional manager should be sent in to flank the court-appointed administrator, there is the risk that we won\u2019t actually be able to apply what we have learnt,\u201d he says.<\/p><p>So far none of the 63 newly trained managers has been hired by the government but Ms Caramazza says she expects that to change. Last week she presented the course at a conference attended by top government officials.<\/p><p>\u201cThe course has shown that something can be done to fight the Mafia but if we don\u2019t get these managers inserted into a job we won\u2019t have succeeded,\u201d says Romano Ambrogi, chairman of Aldai.<\/p>"},{"id":"33721651","uuid":"1a3285c2-276a-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0","title":"Romney makes his last call in Florida","catid":"6","byline":"By Anna Fifield in Sanford, Florida","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 18:07:54 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/1a3285c2-276a-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"Verdict is close after the Republican presidential candidate\u2019s seven years on the campaign trail climax with frantic last-ditch effort","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"US Politics & Policy"},"share":{"webappemail":"PRXHxp","webappshare":"PRW7LR"},"storypackage":[{"articleid":"33721811","title":"Fiscal cliff looms over campaign climax"},{"articleid":"33721801","title":"A fight to the finish"},{"articleid":"33722041","title":"Candidates reach end of campaign trail"},{"articleid":"33722101","title":"Voters in crucial swing county relish influence"}]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 18:07:54 +0000","content":"<p>Striding on to the stage in an airport hangar in Sanford on Monday for his final campaign rally in Florida, Mitt Romney did what has become the hallmark of his stump speeches.<\/p><p>As a few hundred people cheered and the television cameras zoomed in, the Republican presidential candidate shook his head ever so slightly, as if in disbelief: Could all these people really be here for me?<\/p><p>After in effect seven years on the presidential campaign trail, Mr Romney is set to discover if he has been successful in his second bid for the White House.<\/p><p>\u201cWe need every single vote in Florida,\u201d Mr Romney told the crowd. \u201cWe will build a better tomorrow tomorrow.

The UAE has attacked Britain for failing to take a tougher line against Islamists, which it claims are threatening the sovereignty of the country, while Saudi officials reacted angrily last month to news that a parliamentary committee planned to investigate London\u2019s relations with Riyadh.<\/p><p>Britain also faces growing competition from emerging Asian powers, which are big energy customers and come without Britain\u2019s colonial-era baggage. South Korea recently won an oil concession from the UAE and is building the country\u2019s new nuclear power stations. BP, one of four western companies operating the country\u2019s giant 75-year onshore oil concession, has so far been frozen out of bidding for the successor deal.<\/p><p>\u201cThe biggest problem the British have is they take us for granted,\u201d said one Emirati businessman. \u201cThat\u2019s the mistake they always make.\u201d<\/p><p>Mr Cameron has been under pressure from human rights groups for not pushing the UAE and Saudi Arabia to introduce democratic reforms.<\/p><p> \u201cI am a supporter of the Arab spring,\u2019\u2019 he said in a meeting with students in the UAE on Monday. \u201cThe idea of moving towards more open societies and more democracies is good for the Middle East and north Africa.\u2019\u2019 <\/p><p>However, Mr Cameron was also careful to insist that it was important to respect individual countries\u2019 \u201cjourneys\u201d towards change.<\/p><p>Additional reporting by Carola Hoyos<\/p>"},{"id":"33721671","uuid":"de6e2428-2751-11e2-9863-00144feabdc0","title":"Island stalemate","catid":"96","byline":"","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 18:21:08 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/de6e2428-2751-11e2-9863-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"Arbitration is the only solution for China-Japan dispute; it is not inconceivable that simple human error could rapidly escalate into conflict","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Front page"},"share":{"webappemail":"UdgRPl","webappshare":"QisJhK"},"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 18:21:08 +0000","content":"<p>Beijing and Tokyo insist they want   a diplomatic solution to the dispute over the Senkaku islands in the East China Sea.

Real manufacturing output in America has stagnated since 2000. The trade deficit in manufactured goods has swollen and capital investment in manufacturing has been declining since 1989. For some, these trends are an acceptable consequence of the US becoming more sophisticated in its output. But the notion that the US \u201cowns\u201d the highest-value part of manufacturing, while countries such as China do the low-skilled stuff, is simplistic. Many products, such as iPad components, are not, and increasingly cannot be, made in America.<\/p><p>Some say this reflects a natural transition towards a post-industrial, service-based economy; America will prosper, they believe, by focusing on research and development while others make things. Based on this thinking, the US has embarked on a dangerous experiment. It has let its industrial commons \u2013 its supplier network, workforce and institutions such as universities \u2013 erode.<\/p><p>This is based on the bad assumption that manufacturing is not linked to innovation and that no value comes from proximity of R&D to manufacturing. In many contexts, however, including biotechnology, advanced materials, nanotechnology and advanced displays, R&D and manufacturing draw from common knowledge and skill bases. What you can make determines what you can design, and vice versa. Scaling up the process technology is just as difficult as finding the right product design. In these contexts, manufacturing competence is integral to innovation.<\/p><p>Erosion of the industrial commons is hard to reverse. Once the jobs move away, students stop studying in those fields. When supplier networks and engineering knowhow are lost, they are costly to bring back. A country that loses its industrial commons loses its capacity to innovate, and compete globally.<\/p><p>This is not a call for an industrial policy. As the failings of government-supported Solyndra, the solar-panel maker, made clear, governments are not good at picking winners. The market does that job better. But the state plays an essential role in laying the foundations. Here is what the US government needs to do to restore America\u2019s industrial commons.<\/p><p>First, it must increase its support for research in process and manufacturing science, especially in fields such as additive manufacturing, advanced materials, nanotechnology and biotechnology-derived products (used to make drugs, speciality chemicals, and nutritional products). The federal government spends more than $140bn a year on R&D now, but virtually none of that goes to manufacturing-related science. The Obama administration has proposed creating a network of National Institutes of Manufacturing and a budget of about $1bn to support this kind of research. It is dubious whether Congress will approve this spending. But even if it did, the figure would still be tiny compared to the $100bn of federal spending on R&D for defence and healthcare alone.<\/p><p>Second, the US needs a workforce with the right skills. Gone are the days when a strong back and good discipline were enough for a production worker. Operators of sophisticated computerised machine tools must understand geometry, programming and statistics. Despite high unemployment, skilled jobs in manufacturing are unfilled for lack of qualified candidates. This is the time to be reinvigorating community colleges, not to axe them.<\/p><p>Finally, America should scrap tax policies that make it attractive to conduct R&D and production abroad. For a company with big profits outside the US, it can make more sense to invest in manufacturing and R&D overseas than to repatriate dollars that would be taxed at one of the world\u2019s highest corporate tax rates. Moving to a territorial tax-based system (with minimum taxes for profits booked in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands) is one solution. Allowing companies to repatriate foreign profits tax-free, provided they are invested in R&D, training, and capital expenditure, is another.<\/p><p>The US faced similar fiscal pressures in the early 1950s but in those years it created government agencies such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. Those investments in research paid off in the form of economic growth that ultimately cut our debt. Our next president should heed the lesson.<\/p><p> The writers are professors at Harvard Business School and authors of \u2018Producing Prosperity\u2019<\/p>"},{"id":"33721731","uuid":"c0f20ba8-1464-11e2-8cf2-00144feabdc0","title":"Software is king in an industrial rebirth","catid":"621","byline":"By Andrew Keen","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 18:38:43 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/c0f20ba8-1464-11e2-8cf2-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"Everyone can have the chance to emulate James Dyson so long as they have products developed by the tech sector, writes   Andrew Keen","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Comment"},"share":{"webappemail":"RMyAHm","webappshare":"Wr9Mw9"},"stocks":{"ca:RIM":"Research in Motion Ltd","us:GOOG":"Google Inc","jp:6752":"Panasonic Corp","us:MSFT":"Microsoft Corp","fi:NOK1V":"Nokia Oyj","us:FB":"Facebook Inc","jp:6758":"Sony Corp","us:AMZN":"Amazon.com Inc","us:HPQ":"Hewlett-Packard Co","us:DELL":"Dell Inc"},"storypackage":[{"articleid":"33721141","title":"Apple\u2019s share of tablet market slips"}]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 18:38:43 +0000","content":"<p>Software, to borrow a phrase from venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, is eating the world.

Yet some people remain sceptical. Sir James Dyson, an inventor, has told the BBC that hardware manufacturers are a smarter investment than software companies. \u201cThe hardware trade is growing at a much faster rate around the world than social media or any of the sorts of things at Silicon Valley,\u201d Sir James says. \u201cApple\u2019s success is not based on software at all, it\u2019s based on hardware. All the other top 20 hardware companies are growing at a much faster rate than the Googles and Microsofts of this world, so much so that they are getting into hardware.\u201d<\/p><p>I wonder when Sir James last used an Apple product. Using the iPhone without the latest version of Apple\u2019s iOS mobile operating system or its iTunes software would be like trying to drive a car without an engine. Apple may generate most of its revenue from hardware sales but it is dependent upon its software.<\/p><p>There is something slightly archaic about a binary division of the business world into hardware and software companies. The most successful creators of value are enterprises such as Apple, whose success is predicated on seamlessly integrating its proprietary software into its hardware. Meanwhile, companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Sony, Panasonic, RIM, Nokia and Dell have all failed to develop popular software of their own and are at risk of decline.<\/p><p>Manufacturing is experiencing a renaissance. Its share of global output is 17.4 per cent, the highest it has been in more than a decade. But when it comes to manufacturing start-ups, crowd-sourced software platforms such as Kickstarter and AngelList play an increasingly important role in providing funding for their success. For example, Pebble Technology, a watch manufacturer, raised $10.47m via Kickstarter this year. <\/p><p>But there is a more profound technological trend that hardware nostalgists fail to acknowledge. With the increasing affordability of desktop 3D printers we can all manufacture physical things in our own homes using computer-aided design software. Everyone can become a James Dyson. <\/p><p>Neil Gershenfeld, the director of the Center for Bits and Atoms at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, describes this trend as the \u201cdigital fabrication revolution\u201d. He writes in Foreign Affairs magazine that: \u201cDigital fabrication will allow individuals to design and produce tangible objects on demand, wherever and whenever they need them.\u201d This revolution, which turns our homes into factories where we can make anything from dollhouse furniture to space rockets, is driven as much by software as hardware. Everything is an algorithm now, as Chris Anderson, former Wired magazine editor-in-chief and chief executive of 3D Robotics, writes in his book Makers. <\/p><p>Nearly everything of value in this new industrial revolution will be software. The value of the products created by 3D printers will depend on their algorithms. And so the main players are likely, like today\u2019s Facebook or Google or Amazon, to be primarily software companies. <\/p><p>Sir James and other critics are therefore wrong to argue against government investment in software. As 3D printers become more and more affordable, what will distinguish the winners from the losers is the innovation of their algorithms. Just as Britain led the analogue industrial revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, so there is now an opportunity for this country to catch up with the US and lead the digital industrial revolution in the 21st century. There is a long-running and important debate about when the state should support companies. But if the UK government is to support industries, it is better off helping software companies. This will enable Britain to best compete in an industrial economy driven by software innovation.

He would offer a Treasury guarantee to support companies struggling to raise funds for big infrastructure projects.<\/p><p>Among the schemes tipped to receive the Treasury\u2019s help is a 20-mile sewer which Thames Water wants to build under London. This will cost a hefty \u00a34.1bn and is expected to take seven years to complete. <\/p><p>Prima facie, the tunnel seems an ideal project for the scheme. By ending the dumping of untreated effluent into the Thames, the sewer will be beneficial for the environment and improve the life of Londoners. It is also expected to generate thousands of jobs and will allow Britain to comply with EU water quality directives. <\/p><p>However, it is debatable whether this project deserves a government guarantee. Thames Water\u2019s management has known for more than a decade that the company would have to finance a large project as part of the effort to clean up the Thames. But instead of setting aside the necessary funds, it paid huge dividends to its shareholders. It also let its liabilities balloon, making it impossible to raise new debt from the market without threatening its investment-grade status. Maintaining this is a requirement under the UK licensing regime. A guarantee would imply that this type of profligacy is acceptable and should even be supported by the taxpayer who will be on the hook if things go wrong. This is not the way to use the government balance sheet.<\/p><p>It could be argued that the Thames tunnel is an exceptionally beneficial project and that giving it an investment guarantee is the only way for it to obtain long-term-funding. But then the guarantee should come with several strings attached. This should include a demand that the company raises fresh equity to finance a significant share of the project\u2019s cost. It should also impose restrictions on future dividends, so that the Treasury\u2019s balance sheet is not used to subsidise shareholders.<\/p><p>Finally, there are questions about the regulator, Ofwat. Its role, alongside government, is to ensure that a utility has the means to make the necessary investment while also earning reasonable returns. In this case, the balance was manifestly wrong. If the government should think twice about extending a guarantee to Thames Water it should also look closely at how this situation came to pass. <\/p>"},{"id":"33721751","uuid":"2f07d3a0-2754-11e2-9863-00144feabdc0","title":"Copycat litigation threat for rating agencies","catid":"75","byline":"By FT reporters","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 18:46:58 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/2f07d3a0-2754-11e2-9863-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"Landmark ruling that S&P misled 12 local councils in Australia by awarding a triple A ratings to complex derivatives could embolden others","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Financial Services"},"share":{"webappemail":"StWhFk","webappshare":"StWisH"},"image":true,"popup":{"full":"http:\/\/im.ft-static.com\/content\/images\/362e4300-277a-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0.img","preview":"http:\/\/im.ft-static.com\/content\/images\/34e42dde-277a-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0.img"},"storypackage":[{"articleid":"33720551","title":"S&P misled investors, court finds"},{"articleid":"33721821","title":"Holding the rating agencies to account"},{"articleid":"33720871","title":"War of words erupts among rating agencies"}]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 18:46:58 +0000","content":"<p>Rating agencies have faced intense scrutiny over the past few years. Blamed for being too generous in their ratings on complex derivatives that went sour during the financial crisis, they have struggled to repair their reputation. <\/p><p>Monday\u2019s Australian court ruling that Standard & Poor\u2019s misled 12 local councils in Australia by awarding a triple A rating to complex derivatives products that collapsed in value less than two years after they were created by ABN Amro\u2019s wholesale banking unit is being hailed as a landmark case. It is a ruling that some lawyers argue will lead to copycat litigation brought against rating agencies in Europe and possibly even the US. <\/p><p>But the Australian case \u2013 which focuses on the sale of constant proportion debt obligations (CPDOs) sold to local councils by an intermediary in 2006 \u2013 also raises questions. Why is it that agencies including S&P, Moody\u2019s and Fitch, which have faced controversy over their role in the rating of transactions at the heart of subprime crisis, have not been held to account elsewhere?<\/p><p>In fact, many cases have been brought. But the credit rating agencies have historically argued in the US that they act in a role that some describe as equivalent to a restaurant or film critic. The agencies say they offer ratings based on opinions, and as such they are protected by the US constitution\u2019s guarantee of free speech. Any research carries heavy disclaimers to that effect. <\/p><p>Lawyers say all the agencies have long shown that they will fight \u201ctooth and nail\u201d to defend this right and have demonstrated they are successfully able to do this both in the US and other jurisdictions.<\/p><p>Roughly five dozen financial crisis-era cases have been filed round the world against credit rating agencies. Most of these were filed in the US and concerned securities linked to mortgage products. About a dozen were filed in Germany and Italy, which mostly focused on bonds and other products connected to Lehman Brothers, the failed investment bank.<\/p><p>About 40 cases have already been dismissed or withdrawn, although some of the dismissals are being appealed in higher courts. Another 20 cases, including about six in Italy and Germany, are still moving through the courts.<\/p><p>Despite the record so far, some claim the Australian ruling could embolden others to launch their own cases. <\/p><p>IMF (Australia), a company that invests in litigation and funded the recent action, says it has retained lawyers to investigate whether it would be appropriate to launch similar claims in Europe against S&P and Royal Bank of Scotland, which now owns ABN Amro\u2019s wholesale banking arm, on behalf of European banks and pension funds if there is sufficient demand to make it commercially viable.<\/p><p>John Walker, executive director of IMF (Australia), says the litigation company is proposing to fund claims in the Netherlands for European claimants in relation to CPDOs worth about \u20ac2bn sold by ABN Amro and rated by S&P, again subject to commercial viability.<\/p><p>James Cox, a Duke University law professor who has been following the ratings litigation, says the Australian ruling could also have some impact on US judges. <\/p><p>\u201cWhile courts generally are not expressly moved much by what happens abroad, the fact that suits are permitted to move forward in Australia and elsewhere reduces some of the force of the argument that if you impose liability on credit rating agencies in the US these transactions will just move off shore,\u201d says Mr Cox.<\/p><p>Lawyers in Europe, meanwhile, say they are monitoring the case. However, they say successfully pursuing the agencies will be difficult under English or US law given that the circulars sent with any rating have clearly worded disclaimers. <\/p><p>Added to that it might be difficult for an investor to pursue a claim until it has been established that it incurred a loss, something that could take time.  <\/p><p>\u201cThe other problem is, who is the rating addressed to? Normally that\u2019s the issuer of the bonds and not the bondholders themselves. So then it becomes an issue of whether there was a duty of care to the bondholders,\u201d says one lawyer. <\/p><p>S&P says that it plans to appeal against the decision and rejects any suggestion that its opinions were inappropriate. Moody\u2019s and Fitch did not respond to requests for comment. <\/p><p>However, the agencies have continued to express confidence in their model, pointing to recent court victories in the US. They also point out that, six years after the start of the financial crisis, statutes of limitations for bringing new claims are starting to shut the door on more lawsuits.<\/p><p>Floyd Abrams, an attorney for S&P, says: \u201cIt is highly unlikely that this Australian court opinion will have any significant impact elsewhere. The case does not involve mortgage-backed securities. And the ruling does not recognise \u2013 as courts in the US and elsewhere generally have \u2013 that ratings are opinions which are not actionable unless disbelieved by those that issued them.\u201d<\/p><p>Moody\u2019s, meanwhile, spent just 15 minutes of its most recent investor day discussing legal claims against the company, where general counsel John Goggins rattled off a list of reasons why \u201calmost three dozen of the more than four dozen\u201d US ratings cases have been dismissed or withdrawn. \u201cAs we get closer to the six-year anniversary of the start of the credit crisis, it is going to get more difficult to bring these types of claims,\u201d he said.<\/p><p>One unknown in the US remains the possibility of civil action by regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice, which are investigating S&P\u2019s ratings of structured products, according to a McGraw-Hill filing in July. <\/p><p>To date, the SEC has taken no enforcement actions over ratings, though two years ago it did publicly scold Moody\u2019s for considering the risk of reputational damage instead of just financial factors when deciding not to downgrade some credit derivatives in 2007. <\/p><p>Reporting by Mary Watkins, Brooke Masters, Stephen Foley and Neil Hume<\/p>"},{"id":"33721761","uuid":"8282f8ee-2726-11e2-9863-00144feabdc0","title":"Peso offers a punt on US election","catid":"191","byline":"By Jamie Chisholm","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 18:47:47 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/8282f8ee-2726-11e2-9863-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"Mexico\u2019s currency has the potential to offer the most excitement whatever the outcome of the presidential poll north of its border","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Markets"},"share":{"webappemail":"StW3Ow","webappshare":"StW592"},"stocks":{"uk:HSBA":"HSBC_Holdings_PLC"},"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 18:47:47 +0000","content":"<p>Fancy a forex punt on the US election?

Barring the utterly un\u00adexpected, Mr Obama is assured of carrying the west coast and the eastern seaboard north of Virginia, with the possible exception of New Hampshire, site of one of Mr Romney\u2019s several homes.<\/p><p>The challenger is pretty much guaranteed the Deep South, Texas and swaths of the Midwestern heartland. That leaves the identity of the next president in the hands of just nine states. They are Nevada and Colorado in the Rocky Mountains; Ohio, Wisconsin and Iowa in the mostly industrial Midwest; Florida, home to many pensioners and Hispanics; neighbouring southern states Virginia and North Carolina; and tiny northeastern New Hampshire.<\/p><p>Everybody knows no Republican has become president without Ohio. But if there is a last-minute surge towards Mr Romney \u2013 like that which carried Ronald Reagan to a landslide victory over Jimmy Carter in 1980, after national polls showed them tied with a week to go \u2013 other states could be in play. The Romney camp claims these would include Pennsylvania, Michigan and Minnesota, where the Republican\u2019s campaign has embarked on a last-minute advertising blitz.<\/p><p>It is generally agreed that there are more ways for Mr Obama than for Mr Romney to reach 270. He could even compensate for losing Ohio by winning five of the smaller battleground states, all of which he carried in 2008. By the same token, if Mr Romney loses Ohio, he will need close to a clean sweep in the battlegrounds.<\/p><p>This makes voter turnout operations, known as the \u201cground game\u201d, vital. The Obama campaign claims it has more boots on the ground than Mr Romney. But enthusiasm for the former, especially among the young, is patently lower than in 2008 and overall turnout is likely to be less than the 60 per cent achieved four years ago, which was high by recent standards. The after-effects of Hurricane Sandy could depress it further.<\/p><p>THE EVENING UNFOLDS<\/p><p>This could be a far longer night than in 2008, when the networks declared Mr Obama president by 9.30pm. Even in important states where the polls close early, such as Ohio and Virginia, it may be hours before results are known. Remember Florida in 2000, when the call for Al Gore over George W. Bush was reversed in the wee small hours, and only \u201cresolved\u201d by the Supreme Court a full month later.<\/p><p>7pm Polls close in five states with 60 electoral college votes (all times are eastern standard time)<\/p><p>The big one is Virginia, carried by Mr Obama four years ago. It also has a hotly contested Senate race between two former governors, Democrat Tim Kaine and Republican George Allen. In Indiana, Mr Obama scored a victory in 2008 \u2013 an unlikely one, given that it had voted Republican every time since 1964. Again, a tight Senate race for the seat long held by moderate Republican Dick Lugar, defeated in his party\u2019s primary by Tea Party adherent Richard Mourdock, could produce a bigger than expected turnout, helping the Democrat.<\/p><p>7.30pm Three states with 38 votes<\/p><p>The mother of all battles is Ohio. Indeed, the whole campaign seems to have been waged there. But North Carolina, very much of the Deep South but with a long progressive strain in the academic triangle around state capital Raleigh, also features. Mr Obama won it narrowly four years ago but would do well to repeat this time. If he does, he will be set fair.<\/p><p>8pm Seventeen states with 172 votes<\/p><p>The largest haul in one hour. The biggest single prize is Florida, perhaps Mr Romney\u2019s best early hope of a significant gain. The Hispanic population, its Cuban element once solidly Republican, is now more diverse; its heavy concentration of pensioners worries about healthcare and social security. At least half a dozen states suffered from hurricane Sandy, to the point that the ability to vote may be affected. Illinois, which Mr Obama calls home, looks safe for the president; if it is close, he may be in trouble. Arkansas polls close at 8.30pm. Former president Bill Clinton\u2019s magic no longer works here; the state of his birth leans Republican.<\/p><p>9pm Thirteen states with 153 votes<\/p><p>The behemoths are New York and Texas.

Thanks to the disclaimers pasted on the front of reports, they were deemed to be providers of honestly held opinions rather than investment advice on which reliance could and should be placed. <\/p><p>Quite how far this seeming immunity has been punctured by a judgment in an Australian court remains to be seen. The judge found Standard & Poor\u2019s to have been negligent in awarding a triple A rating to a complex derivative product issued by ABN Amro. Shortly after this was sold, and in common with many other such securities that enjoyed similar assurances, it tanked in value.<\/p><p>The case, while different in outcome, bears many of the hallmarks of other erroneous ratings decisions that have been legally contested. S&P was paid by an issuer that was more interested in selling the securities for the highest price than ensuring that investors had all the information they required to evaluate them. The court said the rating agency had neither asked sufficient questions nor sufficiently stress-tested the product.<\/p><p>If the court was less minded to see this as an honest mistake, it was perhaps because of the nature of the security in question. Known as a constant proportion debt obligation (CPDO) \u2013 its whole purpose was to have a triple A rating while paying returns generally offered by a lower-rated product. Even in the Alice-through-the-looking-glass world of structured products, the assumptions needed to give such a rating were sufficiently heroic to stretch the judge\u2019s credulity.<\/p><p>It is right that rating agencies should be held to account if they are negligent. They should not be able to shelter behind the argument that investors are not their clients. It is precisely their role as gatekeepers to the capital markets that means they should be responsible for the ratings they give. To the extent this judgment makes them more conscious of their responsibility it is welcome.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, even if the ruling stands \u2013 and it will be appealed \u2013 it may not provide a durable solution to the problem of investor over-reliance on fallible ratings. Short of outright misrepresentation or collusion to deceive, the concept of negligence will remain slippery. Things will only change once rating agencies are regulated more rigorously and paid for by investors rather than issuers. In the meantime, investors should handle ratings with care.<\/p>"},{"id":"33721841","uuid":"19beda7a-24d4-11e2-86fb-00144feabdc0","title":"Air\u2009New\u2009Zealand\u2019s safety video","catid":"476","byline":"By Rose Jacobs","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 19:05:07 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/19beda7a-24d4-11e2-86fb-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"The carrier has used its country\u2019s association with Tolkien\u2019s \u2018Lord of the Rings\u2019 to produce its own \u2018Middle\u2009Earth\u2019\u2009version, writes Rose Jacobs","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Management"},"share":{"webappemail":"PS53Rj","webappshare":"PS3fb3"},"stocks":{"nz:AIR":"Air New Zealand Ltd"},"image":true,"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 19:05:07 +0000","content":"<p>Agency: Inhouse\/Weta Workshop Territory: Worldwide<\/p><p>Verdict: 5\/5<\/p><p>Airlines are usually so committed to the \u201cwe take your safety seriously\u201d credo that any suggestion of humour or fun with their preflight video messages seems anathema.

The macroeconomic indicators in Colombia have been doing very well in the past six years, and are still very good and this helped to create an good business environment for markets,\u201d the former IMF economist adds.<\/p><p>That played its role in the growth of the stock market: Back in 2003 the traded volume at the Bolsa de Valores de Colombia, or BVC, was a meagre $204m. Last year, the traded volume was $1.2bn. The market cap roamed around $20bn. Today it is $250bn. Between 2010 and 2012 the BVC launched 14 IPOs with a total issuance of $8.2bn. Today, the bourse has more than 1m retail investors.<\/p><p>By market size, the BVC, is the fourth largest stock exchange in Latin America after Brazil, Mexico, and Chile. \u201cArgentina used to be third or fourth market in Latin America, and today it is the sixth or seventh; Colombia used to be eight, today it is the fourth,\u201d C\u00f3rdoba adds. The BVC is also part of the Mercado Integrado Latinoamericano, or Mila, an initiative that, by market capitalisation, is already the second largest market in the region that last year tied up bourses of Colombia, Per\u00fa and Chile to harmonise trading. \u201cOne way to keep growing is to join forces with your neighbours,\u201d he says.<\/p><p>Some of those neighbours have already established brokerages and investment banks in Colombia, such as Chile&#8217;s Larra\u00ednVial, Peru&#8217;s BCP. Brazil&#8217;s Ita\u00fa is about to do so. \u201cOur idea is to internationalise as much as possible our equity, futures, and derivatives markets, our new ETF, to adopt international standards, so that investors could find in Colombia what they find anywhere in the world,\u201d he says, highlighting that the BVC used the NASDAQ OMX marketplace platform.<\/p><p>Some are already in. By the end of September this year, foreign investors represented 13 per cent of the BVC\u2019s traded volume. &#8220;This is a virtuous circle: if you do things well, you grow, if you grow by doing things well, you keep growing.&#8221;<\/p><p><strong>Related reading:<\/strong><a title=\"Blog: [snap]: Colombia regulator seizes Interbolsa\" href=\"..\/2012\/11\/02\/snap-colombia-regulator-seizes-interbolsa\/\"><br \/>[snap]: Colombia regulator seizes Interbolsa<\/a>, beyondbrics<a title=\"Andean exchanges move to integrate\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/5adf547a-9df1-11de-8de8-00144feabdc0.html\"><br \/>Andean exchanges move to integrate<\/a>, FT (2009)<\/p>","protectionlevel":"free"},{"id":"33721881","uuid":"8e20a5de-2442-11e2-b38c-00144feabdc0","title":"Opportunity beckons north of the Limpopo","catid":"2971","byline":"By William Wallis and Andrew England","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 19:15:46 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/8e20a5de-2442-11e2-b38c-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"Telecoms companies, retailers and breweries have been blazing the investment trail, say William Wallis and Andrew England","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"South Africa and Africa 2012"},"share":{"webappemail":"PS53AZ","webappshare":"PS3eUH"},"stocks":{"hk:1398":"Industrial Commercial Bank of China Ltd","us:WMT":"Wal-Mart Stores Inc","uk:BARC":"Barclays PLC","za:SBK":"Standard Bank Group Ltd"},"image":true,"storypackage":[{"articleid":"33721941","title":"Strikes provide a new aspect to risks elsewhere"},{"articleid":"33721981","title":"Banks follow the money in pursuit of new markets"},{"articleid":"33721951","title":"Pensions chief aims to build up trust beyond the border"},{"articleid":"33721921","title":"Continental policy pulled in different directions"},{"articleid":"33721961","title":"Love-hate relationship provides good prospects in two countries"}]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 19:15:46 +0000","content":"<p>In the not so distant past, South Africa\u2019s highest profile export to the rest of Africa was ex-special forces personnel who found work post apartheid as mercenaries and private security consultants. When they were not doing battle, they could reliably be found propping up the bars in continental trouble spots, at least until domestic and international opprobrium prompted a change in legislation that proscribed their kind of business.<\/p><p>Today, you are more likely to run into a South African supermarket manager in the foyer of one of the continent\u2019s proliferating hotels.<\/p><p>Like China, India, Brazil and other emerging powers, South Africa has been tapping into the continental boom, and its companies looking to expand beyond their relatively mature domestic market have found new sources of profit to their north.<\/p><p>The country\u2019s economy began to grow steadily as business revived in the years after international sanctions had been lifted and it opened up following the 1994 transition from white minority to black majority rule. Economic migrants and business people from across Africa flocked in.<\/p><p>But, in some ways, the tables are turning and amid rising labour and energy costs, gaping inequality, a failing education system and \u2013 most recently \u2013 turmoil in the mining sector, the surge in growth north of the Limpopo River now provides a vital opportunity for South African business.<\/p><p>While South Africa struggles with sluggish growth of about 2.5 per cent, sub-Saharan Africa on average is expanding at a healthy 5 per cent. Many South African groups see the continent\u2019s growing consumer class as a key driver of growth.<\/p><p>Trade with the rest of the continent grew to $30bn last year, a threefold increase over the past decade. While trade with Asia has also been growing fast, it has done so at a deficit. Moreover, 85 per cent of South African exports to Asia are raw materials. By contrast, those to the rest of Africa trade at a substantial surplus and nearly half are manufactured \u2013 valuable in an environment where jobs are scarce.<\/p><p>South African telecoms companies, retailers and breweries have been blazing the trail for investment. By the early 2000s the country was the largest single source of inward investment into the rest of Africa outside the oil and gas industry. <\/p><p>\u201cFinancial services ... followed where the breweries are going, the telecom companies and the retailers. Because, generally, where those three are going, it\u2019s telling you there\u2019s a developing middle market,\u201d says Ralph Mupita, head of emerging markets at Old Mutual.<\/p><p>There are also examples of multinationals looking to South Africa\u2019s sophisticated corporate sector as a stepping stone to the continent. Barclays splashed out $4.5bn for a 55 per cent stake in Absa in 2005, China\u2019s ICBC paid $5.5bn for 20 per cent of  Standard Bank two years later, and last year US retail company Walmart completed its $2.4bn acquisition of a majority holding in Massmart.<\/p><p>Yet as the African recovery extends, competition facing South Africa is heating, particularly as companies look to expand beyond neighbouring markets. Standard Bank points out the country\u2019s footprint is largely limited to countries in the Southern African Development Community stretching up to Tanzania. \u201cOf the continent\u2019s 10 fastest-growing economies, South Africa enjoys strong access in Zambia and Mozambique, but gains are moderate across north, west and much of east Africa,\u201d the bank says.<\/p><p>Only 4 per cent of South Africa\u2019s exports were directed at Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous nation and among its fastest growing, while of China\u2019s exports to Africa, 16 per cent went to Nigeria. Chinese companies moreover have the advantage of strong state backing with subsidised financing and cheap labour. Responding to this kind of pressure, the South African government has raised the limits on outflows into other parts of Africa.<\/p><p>\u201cSouth Africa still has a scale advantage in that, using the macro potential limit that they\u2019ve allowed for banks to help companies grow in Africa, it\u2019s reasonably easy to do cross-border funding. Banks can leverage their own balance sheet into Africa up to about 40 per cent,\u201d says Ben Kruger, deputy chief executive at Standard Bank.<\/p><p>South Africa promotes itself commercially and financially as a gateway to Africa, and diplomatically as both a champion of continental causes and a bridge to the rest of the world. <\/p><p>Not only is it Africa\u2019s largest and most developed economy, it is also its sole member of the G20 group of nations and, last year, it was welcomed into the so-called Brics, the elite club of fast growing emerging markets in what was seen as a nod to its position in Africa as a whole, rather than its match to Brazil, Russia, India or China.<\/p><p>But competition on the continent is strong, and South Africa\u2019s role and that of its companies are at times resented by neighbours. As other regional powers grow and their financial sectors deepen \u2013 notably in Nigeria and Kenya \u2013 the case weakens for South Africa\u2019s status as the gateway to the sub-Saharan region.<\/p><p>This position may have weakened further after  nearly two months of at times violent industrial unrest and longer than that of policy uncertainty.<\/p><p>South Africa still has by far the most developed financial and physical infrastructure on the continent as well as world class regulation. But its relatively mature economy may become less attractive if it begins to provide the higher risks associated with emerging market investment while producing the lower returns typical of the developing world.<\/p><p>On two fronts, however, African growth looks set to provide at least a partial remedy for some of South Africa\u2019s woes. First, government members hope it will help to stem the flow of migration, potentially an important factor in stability in light of xenophobic rioting in 2008, fuelled by resentment among black South Africans at the number of jobs taken by migrants.<\/p><p>Second, it could help spur a recovery at home. \u201cIf we grow in tandem with the rest of the continent there are clear benefits. We are a population of 50m people and yet we account for 50 per cent of the trade on the continent,\u201d says Kgalema Motlanthe, deputy president and potential challenger for the top job.<\/p><p>Part of the equation, he adds, will be investment in infrastructure to strengthen regional integration and address colonial era trade routes. \u201cIf you look at the rail lines in Africa, they are all leading to the ports because it was meant for extracting resources. There\u2019s no interconnectivity, so even intra-trade is hampered by the absence of that infrastructure,\u201d he says.<\/p><p>There were great hopes South Africa would lead an African renaissance after it defied the doomsayers and weathered the end of apartheid with Nelson Mandela providing a rare model in reconciliation. In 2012, however, it looks as likely that the rest of the continent will be a reverse lifeline.<\/p><p>\u201cThe world is going to require new areas of demand and growth. China, India and Brazil provided the engine for the last few years. Africa\u2019s turn is next,\u201d says Pravin Gordhan, the finance minister.<\/p>"},{"id":"33721891","uuid":"57e7682c-2749-11e2-9863-00144feabdc0","title":"Dutch finance minister set for lead role","catid":"75","byline":"By Matt Steinglass in Amsterdam","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 19:12:45 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/57e7682c-2749-11e2-9863-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"If the new Dutch coalition government is to succeed, much will depend on Labour's Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the incoming finance minister","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Europe"},"share":{"webappemail":"PS51Jg","webappshare":"Su2EZ3"},"storypackage":[{"articleid":"33721621","title":"Healthcare dispute hits Dutch coalition"}]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 19:12:45 +0000","content":"<p>If the new Dutch coalition government is to succeed, much will depend on Labour's Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the incoming finance minister.<\/p><p>Mr Dijsselbloem and Diederik Samsom, Labour's leader in parliament, negotiated the controversial coalition agreement with Mark Rutte, the Liberal prime minister.<\/p><p>Mr Dijsselbloem, 46, exemplifies the pragmatism many had expected from the new government.\u00a0<\/p><p>A soft-spoken agronomist with a doctorate in economics, he has spent a decade in parliament working largely behind the scenes rather than in front of the cameras, and is known as an issues-oriented policy wonk with a strong sense of loyalty.\u00a0<\/p><p>He shares Labour\u2019s broadly pro-European outlook, and is expected to be diplomatic in negotiations over eurozone crisis measures.<\/p><p>That would mark a stylistic change from the previous finance minister, Jan Kees de Jager.

He had left a 22-year career at Syngenta, the multinational seed producer, with an ambition to introduce food that is healthy as well as tasty to a wider audience.<\/p><p>The company is based in the Westland region. At the heart of the \u20ac15bn Dutch horticultural industry, the region is home to the country\u2019s two biggest auction houses, through which growers supply flowers, fruit and vegetables. A sophisticated logistics system has developed to distribute the produce around the world.<\/p><p>The challenge<\/p><p>By 2002, Mr Baan had acquired the business and renamed it Koppert Cress. Although it was renowned for efficiency and quality, had invested in automation and had patented techniques for packaging and sowing, it had ceased to expand.<\/p><p>Mr Baan identified the main obstacle as the auction system. The prices achieved for Koppert cresses and seedlings now reflected little more than the costs of production. The company also faced greater competition \u2013 not least from abroad \u2013 as well as rising prices for energy, land and labour. <\/p><p> The strategy<\/p><p>Mr Baan realised he had to add value by capturing the imagination of potential users, which would enable him to raise prices and protect the business. <\/p><p>By 2008, the number of cresses it produced had risen from five to 20, featuring varieties with distinctive flavours, shapes and colours from around the world. For instance, Sakura cress tastes hot, while Shiso Green tastes of mint and anis. Mr Baan also added specialities, such as Sechuan Buttons \u2013 yellow flowers that make the tongue tingle.  <\/p><p>Mr Baan identified chefs as the key to increasing demand. However, they were using cress as a garnish, whereas Koppert wanted them to use it as an integral part of a dish.<\/p><p>He and his team packed up boxes of samples and set off around Europe to drop them off with chefs.<\/p><p>Any chefs who showed an interest in the samples were asked which food specialists or greengrocers supplied their vegetables. Koppert asked these suppliers which distributors they were supplied by and then asked the distributors to identify the exporters who supplied them. <\/p><p>Koppert Cress then sent its produce to these exporters. Seemingly complex because of the number of intermediaries, introducing the cresses at this point in the chain meant they in fact reached the chefs quickly. <\/p><p>Nevertheless, interest must be maintained among chefs. Mr Baan regularly attends horticultural and culinary events overseas. In 2006 he set up Cressperience, where the worlds of horticulture and gastronomy can meet. One of the draws is a modern kitchen including a prestigious Molteni Podium IV stove.<\/p><p>A gastronome himself, Mr Baan also managed to win endorsements from famed chefs such as El Bulli\u2019s Ferran Adri\u00e0, whom he met through food events. <\/p><p>In addition, Koppert\u2019s cresses are grown on a cellulose material so the seedlings are clean and ready to harvest and use, a convenience appreciated by chefs.<\/p><p> The lessons<\/p><p>From turnover of about \u20ac9m in 2008, Koppert expects sales to have reached \u20ac17m in 2012. <\/p><p>Koppert Cress shows how a company in a traditional industry can create value through innovation. First, it changed the way users thought about its products by transforming simple decorative cresses into premium ingredients.<\/p><p>Second, Koppert Cress created demand by directly approaching chefs and then working back along the distribution chain, instead of supplying to unknown customers through the auction house system, which was based on price competition and volume.<\/p><p>Last, Koppert Cress established relationships with a community of chefs, which enhanced its reputation and branding.<\/p><p>The writers are faculty members at the Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University.

But it points to a wider problem \u2013 over the past few months a handful of other Brazilian banks have run into difficulties as the country\u2019s economy stutters. The 1 per cent GDP growth rate expected for the second half of this year falls embarrassingly short of a typical Bric region\u2019s rate of expansion. <\/p><p>This is a worry for investors in Brazil\u2019s big banks, both homegrown names such as Ita\u00fa-Unibanco and Bradesco, or foreign-owned operators, such as those controlled by Santander, Citigroup and HSBC, even if it is not a matter of life and death.<\/p><p>One of the main pressures that weighed on Brazil\u2019s small failed banks is common across the sector \u2013 an uncomfortable squeeze on profitability stemming from lower revenue on one side and higher bad debt charges on the other.<\/p><p>As the economic outlook has worsened, companies and consumers have tightened their belts, hitting banks\u2019 loan growth prospects. At the same time, more borrowers have found themselves unable to repay their debts, pushing up impairment charges.<\/p><p>Non-performing loan rates have been heading higher again and are typically running at 6 or 7 per cent at most big banks, compared with 1, 2 or 3 per cent in most other big economies.<\/p><p>Adding to the banks\u2019 difficulties has been government pressure to lower the interest rates they charge.  <\/p><p>To an extent this is an overdue resetting of the market \u2013 for the past decade, banks have been charging vast rates unchecked. Now there appears to be a drive to cut the 25 per cent return on equity norm that banks have enjoyed to a number below 15 per cent, in line with international peers.<\/p><p>So what are investors to think? The overriding sentiment of late seems to have been one of mild panic. Rattled no doubt by decades of unreliable boom and bust, the sell-off in the sector has been dramatic.<\/p><p>Banks in Brazil have been among the worst performers of any major market of late. The FTSE Brazil banks index is down 10 per cent so far this year, underperforming global peers by more than 24 per cent. Compare that with the past few years, when they outperformed \u2013 in 2009 by a remarkable 67 per cent; in 2010 by a still presentable 10 per cent; and last year by an ominously more modest 1 per cent \u2013 and it is clear why nerves are fraying again.<\/p><p>The underlying financial performance of the banks does not yet seem to support quite such a bearish view. Ita\u00fa\u2019s pre-tax profits, for example, did fall 17 per cent year on year in the three months to September, but they were still a hefty R$4.7bn. Over the first nine months, profits at the other private-sector bank, Bradesco, were still growing.<\/p><p>Performance at the foreign-owned banks has aroused more concern. Santander\u2019s local business, for example, brought in 14 per cent less profit to the overall group between January and September this year, with analysts highlighting a more deep-seated concern about the faster rate at which non-performing loans were accumulating compared with bad debt provisions to cover them.<\/p><p>At HSBC on Monday, Brazil provided the main negative in an otherwise solid underlying third-quarter performance. The bank did not disclose detailed numbers for its performance in the country though it highlighted Brazilian bad debts and said across Latin America loan impairment charges for the three months to September had jumped 25 per cent.<\/p><p>For such global banks, losing Brazil as a ballast in times of trouble back home is a serious worry. For a narrowly diversified group such as Santander, whose home Spanish market is at the centre of the eurozone crisis, the concern is all the more acute.<\/p><p>There are some anecdotal signs that Brazil\u2019s ills may be easing, with nascent confidence among economic forecasters that GDP growth may head up to 3 or 4 per cent again next year, and a widening belief that bad loan rates may be peaking. There is also a theory that the worst of the troubles will remain in the consumer sector. <\/p><p>That should give a break to those with a strong foothold in corporate and investment banking, potentially benefiting the likes of HSBC and Citigroup. Citi\u2019s Latin America operations did well in the three months to September, with pre-tax profits up by a third.<\/p><p>The results of independent Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual on Wednesday will provide the next test of this more optimistic view of the country\u2019s prospects.<\/p><p>Patrick Jenkins is the Financial Times\u2019 banking editor<\/p>"},{"id":"33722041","uuid":"043472ea-2773-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0","title":"Candidates reach end of campaign trail","catid":"351","byline":"By Richard McGregor in Madison, Wisconsin","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 19:25:30 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/043472ea-2773-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"In nostalgic finale a hoarse, tired president returns to his original launch pad in Iowa","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"US Politics & Policy"},"share":{"webappemail":"REura2","webappshare":"Udp1HB"},"image":true,"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 19:25:30 +0000","content":"<p>Barack Obama, criss-crossing the country and its time zones, arrived at his hotel in the shadow of the majestic state capital building in Wisconsin well after 3am. <\/p><p>Three hours later, as he grabbed some sleep, supporters were already lining up nearby for his next rally.<\/p><p>To make it to the White House, a politician must be exceptional on many levels, in policy and speechmaking, raising money and marshalling and leading a vast political machine that can manage a nationwide election.<\/p><p>But the madness of the final weeks of a hard-fought campaign is a reminder that candidates must also be athletes, with stamina that combines the qualities of sprinter and a long-distance runner.

The shares of the two largest companies in the space, Comcast and Time Warner Cable, had both returned about 40 per cent more than the broader market during the past year as of the end of last week. The outperformance is eminently reasonable. Comcast and TWC, with more than 30m customers between them, have delivered revenue growth ahead of US output. In their most defensive business \u2013 providing households and businesses with internet connections \u2013 subscriber growth has been rock solid.<\/p><p>Things might look a bit different this week, however, after TWC reported its third-quarter results. Internet subscriber additions were hardly terrible, at 85,000 \u2013 but this was fewer new customers than in the third quarter of last year. This follows three quarters of increasing additions. At Comcast, by contrast, customer additions have been accelerating for several quarters, including the third. And TWC has lost significantly more pay-TV customers in the past year than Comcast, despite starting from a much smaller base. It looks, suddenly, like Comcast is the better way to ride the ageing cable rally. Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal content business, which contributes a quarter of profits, is prospering, too.<\/p><p>TWC\u2019s third-quarter numbers should not be blown out of proportion. Its combination of growth, defensiveness and a reasonable if not bargain valuation (16 times this year\u2019s earnings, a bit cheaper than Comcast) remains attractive. It is also an exceptionally generous company with investors: during the past year it has returned almost every penny of its free cash flow in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Comcast has returned only a little more than half of the cash it has churned out. This may, however, represent another point in Comcast\u2019s favour.

He was, he admits, \u201ceconomical with the truth\u201d last time he did an interview with this newspaper. <\/p><p>Sitting in a sleepy Hampstead caf\u00e9 the evening before he was jailed for 13 years, the 48-year-old was eager to tell how he went from high-flying City trader to the recently self-confessed fraudster behind a \u00a332m Ponzi scheme.<\/p><p>\u201cI think the City is as much to blame for what happened as I am,\u201d he said in his last interview before being placed behind bars. \u201cActually, that\u2019s not right. I am completely to blame for my situation, but the City taught me a lot of my bad habits.\u201d<\/p><p>Levene joined City brokerage Phillips & Drew as a tea-boy in 1983. A good grasp of numbers and brash confidence helped him quickly work his way to the trading floor where, for 13 years, he did what he now describes as a \u201csensible job\u201d. <\/p><p>However, it was amid the nervy clamour of the trading floor that he started to cultivate a gambling addiction that would ultimately lead to his downfall.<\/p><p>\u201cIn those days, if you couldn\u2019t take a position on something then people didn\u2019t want you in the City,\u201d he said. <\/p><p>He recalls going to lunches at some of the City\u2019s big banks, where betting would start when the fruit and cheese were served. \u201cPeople would be making a market on how many grapes were in the bowl. Thousands of pounds would be laid out,\u201d he said.<\/p><p>By 1997, Levene had begun spread betting and made his first big ticket loss of \u00a325,000 with a bet on the FTSE. But he went on to win \u00a350,000 and by the end of the decade he was running \u201cbig positions\u201d.<\/p><p>At about this time, he says, friends started to ask him to invest amounts ranging from \u00a3500,000 to \u00a33m to take spread betting positions in companies, indices or IPOs. <\/p><p>Those \u201cfriends\u201d included Brian Souter, the founder of Stagecoach, and Richard Caring, the Ivy restaurant entrepreneur. Neither would discuss Levene\u2019s sentence on Monday. <\/p><p>By in 2007, Levene\u2019s business had lurched out of control. Money from new investors was placed on increasingly speculative bets as he tried to cover losses elsewhere. With stock markets falling and the losses mounting, he was eventually found out.<\/p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t love the money. I know people think that is what it is all about. But I was greedy to be in action; whether I was winning or losing, I was just obsessed with always having a position. That is a very, very bad place to be in,\u201d he said.<\/p><p>Leaning into the Dictaphone, he added: \u201cI do feel remorse. I have gone through massive lows of shame and guilt and I wish I could morally put right what I have done.\u201d<\/p><p>He also said the regulation to clean up the City has not done enough to stop people like him more quickly in future. <\/p><p>However, and in-spite of his recently expressed compunction, Levene was slow to accept the full weight of his crimes. <\/p><p>In an interview with the Financial Times in 2009, he rejected any suggestion that he had operated a Ponzi scheme, adding that he thought it unlikely charges would be brought against him. As late as this summer, he was busy telling people he was the victim of a overzealous fraud agency.<\/p><p>But on Sunday, as he prepared for his last night before prison, he was focused on the future. <\/p><p>\u201cWould I go back to the City? I doubt it, it\u2019s going to be a very different place by the time I get out.\u201d<\/p>"},{"id":"33722081","uuid":"35ff106c-2761-11e2-9863-00144feabdc0","title":"Inmarsat buoyed by data services at sea","catid":"11","byline":"By Duncan Robinson","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 19:46:04 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/35ff106c-2761-11e2-9863-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"Satellite company sees strong growth from its maritime division \u2013 despite tie-up with struggling US network LightSquared weighing on overall revenues","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Technology"},"share":{"webappemail":"QiCixe","webappshare":"QiCiNB"},"stocks":{"uk:ISAT":"Inmarsat PLC"},"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 19:46:04 +0000","content":"<p>Inmarsat, the satellite communications company, saw a growing demand for data services at sea \u2013 despite its tie-up with struggling US wireless network LightSquared weighing on overall revenues.<\/p><p>Revenues at the group\u2019s maritime data division improved markedly in the three months to 30 September, rising by more than a quarter year-on-year to $85.4m. <\/p><p>This growth more than offset falling revenues in Inmarsat\u2019s maritime voice division, where revenues were down 9.3 per cent year-on-year to $19.6m. <\/p><p>Rupert Pearce, chief executive, said: \u201cWe are now a data service company \u2013 85 per cent of our revenues come from data.

He\u2019s heading to socialism,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want any part of that. Besides that, he won\u2019t open up the oil industry. We\u2019ve got enough oil in this country to outdo Saudi Arabia.\u201d<\/p><p>For Alex Triantafilou, chairman of the Hamilton County Republican Party, the crucial task on Tuesday will be getting out the party\u2019s supporters. \u201cWe want to maximise the number of Republican votes here. Winning the county will be crucial to Romney.\u201d<\/p><p>Middle-aged white women, who polls nationally show leaning towards Mr Obama, were particularly important, said Mr Triantafilou. <\/p><p>\u201cThat voter group grew up in conservative households and because of the wars or a tiring of Republicans, they tried something different in 2008. We feel they are going to come home.\u201d <\/p><p> The campaigns have swamped Hamilton County airwaves. In one commercial Mr Romney vows to get people off food stamps by creating 12m new jobs. Before it, a woman in an advert from conservative group American Crossroads said: \u201cMr President, what about your first term tells me another four years would be better?\u201d<\/p><p>In a Democratic advert Mr Obama said that job creation, home values and exports had risen on his watch. \u201cOur auto industry is back and our [war] heroes are coming home.

The grey bars on the left indicate dissenting votes that preferred tighter policy than was included in the corresponding FOMC statement. The pink bars were dissents calling for easier policy. Darkened areas in either colour represent dissents by FOMC govenors, while the lighter areas are dissents by the district bank presidents.<\/p><p>Interesting to us is that most of the dissents in Paul Volcker&#8217;s Fed were in favour of sharper tightening. Volcker, of course, is known as America&#8217;s great inflation-slayer, willing to send the economy into recession to regain control of prices. But even he faced occasional criticism for not being <em>hawkish enough<\/em>.<\/p><p>But as should be clear from looking at the reigns of all three chairmen, the hawkish side is where dissents normally emerge, and they are also more likely to come from district bank presidents than from governors.<\/p><p>Resler puts a few numbers on these trends (our emphasis):<\/p><blockquote><p>Dissents from FOMC policy determination represent slightly more than 5% of all votes cast (Figure 4). However, at least one FOMC member has dissented from the majority\u2018s decision at 122 of the 214 meetings. Multiple dissents (2, 3, or 4) have occurred at 22 meetings.<\/p><p>Notably, the record of these dissents underscores the institutional commitment to price stability. <strong>Dissents by members favoring tighter policy outnumber dissents by those preferring an easier policy by more than three-to-one.<\/strong> District bank presidents have shown a greater willingness to use their FOMC vote to express their differences with the majority than have the FRB governors.<\/p><p><strong>Moreover, dissents by bank presidents have been heavily skewed by toward tighter policy (74) rather than easier policy (10) while Board governors\u2018 dissents have been nearly evenly balanced \u2013 19 for tighter policy and 20 for easier policy.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote><p>And as for how the FOMC has behaved during the Bernanke era:<\/p><blockquote><p>A final observation about policy dissents is that they have become more frequent during Chairman Bernanke\u2018s tenure than they were under either of his predecessors. <strong>Only in his tenure have dissents been cast at more than half of the meetings over which he has presided.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>This greater frequency of dissents likely reflects the controversial character of the unconventional measures that the Federal Reserve has adopted<\/strong> as it has struggled to deal with an unprecedented financial crisis.<\/p><p><strong>The greater frequency of dissent may also be a constructive by-product of the evolution toward more policy transparency and more open communication with the public.<\/strong> Policy-related speeches and other public appearances by all FOMC officials, but especially by the district bank presidents, affords them more opportunities to explain and provide context for their policy views, regardless of whether they dissent. &#8230;<\/p><\/blockquote><p>What the chart doesn&#8217;t show is that for much of Bernanke&#8217;s term, there were two empty governors&#8217; seats that remained unfilled; they are now occupied by Jeremy Stein and Jerome Powell, who were confirmed just in March of this year. So while presiding over committees that were more inclined to dissent than those of his predecessors, Bernanke was also missing two reliable votes &#8212; the result of Republican obstructionism and an oddly passive Obama administration (more the former than the latter, but neither helped).<\/p><p>But two other things have changed since the arrival of Stein and Powell.<\/p><p>One is that a previous dissenter, Minnesota Fed president Narayan Kocherlakota, changed not only his views but also <a onclick=\"if (mFT.openExternal) return mFT.openExternal(this)\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/intl\/cms\/s\/0\/511ec710-034f-11e2-a284-00144feabdc0.html#axzz276BGgMd4\" target=\"_blank\">the way he understands the nature<\/a> of the recovery, and is now &#8220;putting less weight on the structural damage story&#8221; and more on &#8220;persistent demand shortfalls&#8221;.<\/p><p>Kocherlakota even called for his own, less dove-ish version of an Evans Rule.

The rate outside London will also rise by 25p to \u00a37.45, compared with the minimum wage of \u00a36.19.<\/p><p>Mr Johnson called for the rate to be paid by all local authorities in London, as well as across Whitehall. He said the move was \u201cboosting the bottom line\u201d for a growing number of businesses by building motivated, dedicated workforces.<\/p><p>Ed Miliband, Labour leader, proposed ways to make the living wage the norm, including naming and shaming companies that do not pay the wage and introducing rules forcing government contracts to be given only to those that pay it.<\/p><p>Downing Street attacked Labour\u2019s proposal, claiming it could be illegal. However, the European Commission told the Financial Times that living wage conditions in contracts were lawful as long as bidders were informed in advance and the process was fair.<\/p><p>About 45,000 workers across the UK have benefited from the rate since it was introduced in 2005, but nearly 5m workers are paid less than the living wage.<\/p><p>John Wastnage, policy adviser at the British Chambers of Commerce, said it was \u201cfantastic\u201d that some employers found a business case for paying above market rates, such as to retain staff or improve corporate reputation.<\/p><p>But others had different priorities such as investing in training or research and development, he said. These should not be forced into paying it. \u201cThe risk is that if you coerce or even nudge businesses to pay above market rates, you end up with a less competitive economy.\u201d<\/p><p>Neil Carberry, of the CBI employers\u2019 group, said: \u201cSome firms may choose to pay more if they can, but this must be their choice based on their own business situation.\u201d<\/p><p>Apart from councils and charities, companies paying the living wage tend to be financial institutions or City law firms rather than mass employers of low-wage labour such as retailers and hotels.<\/p><p>InterContinental Hotels became the first employer with a workforce dominated by low paid employees to pledge to adopt the London living wage earlier this year. <\/p><p>The group, which owns the Intercontinental on Park Lane as well as Crowne Plaza hotels and Holiday Inns, will phase in the wage over the next five years for both directly employed and outsourced workers. <\/p><p>A little less than half its staff \u2013 dominated by cleaners and caterers \u2013 earn less than the London living wage. The company said it believed the higher rate would help attract and retain the best employees.<\/p><p>Barclays Bank said it had seen greater commitment from lower paid staff since it introduced the living wage in 2004. Productivity has improved, sickness rates are lower and the retention rate for cleaners is 92 per cent, well above the industry standard of 35 per cent, it said. <\/p><p>But the bank\u2019s workforce is dominated by higher paid employees, so the rise in the wage bill would have been less dramatic than for a company reliant on low-wage workers.<\/p><p>The Resolution Foundation think-tank calculates that paying the rate in bars, restaurants and retail would add 5-6 per cent to the wage bill. But there are more than 1m low wage workers in banking, construction and computing, where paying them all the rate would raise wage costs by less than 0.5 per cent.<\/p><p>Additional reporting by Helen Warrell and James Fontanella-Khan<\/p>"},{"id":"33722181","uuid":"2ad04270-2774-11e2-8c4f-00144feabdc0","title":"Stifel to purchase KBW for $575m","catid":"68","byline":"By Arash Massoudi in New York","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 20:36:13 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/2ad04270-2774-11e2-8c4f-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"Boutique bank says the move will add specialised business of researching and advising banks and other financial services companies to its portfolio","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Financials"},"share":{"webappemail":"PSbXWZ","webappshare":"VvcK15"},"stocks":{"us:SF":"Stifel Financial Corp","us:KBW":"KBW Inc"},"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 20:36:13 +0000","content":"<p>KBW, a boutique investment bank that lost scores of employees in the World Trade Center attack but managed to rebuild in the years since, was acquired by Stifel Financial for $575m in cash and shares. <\/p><p>On September 11 2001, 67 of KBW\u2019s 224 employees were killed when terrorists crashed a jet into its offices in the south tower of the World Trade Center.

Finally, a stressed government in the eurozone periphery may find it hard to help its companies.<\/p><p>There is no perfect measure of the value of state guarantees, but the European Financial Stability Facility is pretty close; the bonds of the eurozone\u2019s rescue fund have value purely because of government promises. Last week those promises hit a record value, with EFSF 10-year bond yields, and their spread over German bonds, hitting a new low.

Brazil, Russia, India and China, collectively known as the Bric countries and for some time the main economic engines of the developing world, have all been laggards of late. <\/p><p>This obscures the robust gains of many smaller markets, such as Mexico and the Philippines, which have both hit record levels recently. Stock markets in Indonesia and South Africa have also touched records of late in local currency terms, although weakening currencies have eroded returns in US dollar terms. <\/p><p>Arjun Divecha, chairman of GMO and head of the asset manager\u2019s emerging markets strategy, attributes this to idiosyncratic challenges in each of the larger developing economies \u2013 and the lessons learnt from past crises by the smaller ones, particularly in Asia and Latin America.<\/p><p>\u201cFor different reasons, all the Bric countries have had structural and cyclical problems recently,\u201d Mr Divecha says. \u201cThese smaller markets, on the other hand, are in a good spot right now.\u201d<\/p><p>In fact, the performance of many smaller emerging market bourses since the financial crisis is comparable to that of \u201cdefensive\u201d blue-chip western companies, Goldman Sachs analysts noted in a recent report, despite their cyclical nature. <\/p><p>Goldman attributes these markets\u2019 strong post-crisis performance primarily to the fact that many have proved resilient to turbulence emanating from the eurozone. The lower the correlation to Europe, the better the performance, the analysts concluded. <\/p><p>\u201cThis suggests that while the smaller EM equity outperformers may not be defensive in the sense of being independent of the economic cycle, they have demonstrated a defensiveness to the ups and downs of the euro area situation,\u201d Kamakshya Trivedi and Julian Richers write. <\/p><p>In contrast, the smaller emerging stock markets that have underperformed recently tend to be vulnerable to the eurozone crisis. <\/p><p>For example, the exchanges of Poland and the Czech Republic have enjoyed a rally this year, and are regarded as relatively strong, fiscally prudent members of the EU \u2013 yet both are down over the past 12 months in US dollar terms.<\/p><p>More broadly, the divergence of emerging markets is a sign that investors are increasingly differentiating between countries and even industries in the developing world, rather than lumping disparate countries into one homogenous group, says Ruchir Sharma, head of emerging markets at Morgan Stanley\u2019s asset management arm.<\/p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done with the era where all emerging markets do well,\u201d says Mr Sharma, author of a book, Breakout Nations, on the next clutch of promising developing countries. \u201cWe\u2019re finally starting to see a wide divergence of performance of these markets.\u201d<\/p><p>Mr Sharma\u2019s favoured emerging markets for the next few years are Turkey, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines, the last having reached a peace deal with Muslim separatist rebels after 40 years of conflict.<\/p><p>\u201cThe Philippines was in the wilderness for a long time and it\u2019s now making a comeback,\u201d he says.<\/p><p>Yet many of these smaller emerging markets will be tested by slower growth in the larger developing economies. Many of the outperformers are exposed and correlated to Chinese growth in particular, Goldman notes.<\/p><p>Ironically, China\u2019s stock market is among the worst performers in emerging markets. Although recent data have nurtured hopes that the Chinese economy is stabilising, the Shanghai stock market has continued to tread water. Either this means that the market is overly pessimistic and could be due for a rally or it is a better reflection of the country\u2019s economic reality, strategists say.<\/p><p>In the latter case, \u201cseveral smaller EM equity markets with significant leverage to Chinese growth are vulnerable, both in terms of their own growth performance and in their equity markets\u201d, Goldman\u2019s analysts conclude.<\/p>"},{"id":"33722291","uuid":"29634120-2789-11e2-8c4f-00144feabdc0","title":"Digital embrace yields profit","catid":"621","byline":"By Paul Taylor in New York","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 21:45:14 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/29634120-2789-11e2-8c4f-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"Companies that transform their business through the use of digital technologies demonstrate significantly better financial performance than their peers, according to a new study","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"The Connected Business"},"share":{"webappemail":"Vvqwkq","webappshare":"VvqwRw"},"stocks":{"fr:CAP":"Capgemini"},"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 21:45:14 +0000","content":"<p>Companies that have succeeded in transforming their business through the use of digital technologies such as social media, mobile, analytics and embedded devices benefit from a considerable \u201cdigital advantage\u201d and demonstrate significantly better financial performance than their peers, according to a global study conducted by Capgemini Consulting and the MIT Center for Digital Business.<\/p><p>The study, published on Monday, suggests that the most digitally mature companies \u2013 dubbed the \u201cdigirati\u201d \u2013 outperform their industry competitors on multiple financial metrics. They generate, on average, 9 per cent more revenues through their existing assets, outperform their peers by 26 per cent in terms of profitability, and achieve significantly higher (12 per cent) market valuations.<\/p><p>However, the study also reveals that despite the transformative potential of technology in everything from delivering enhanced efficiency, productivity and collaboration to improving customer experience, few companies are truly capturing the benefits of digital transformation, with the majority at serious risk of falling significantly behind their competitors. <\/p><p>Didier Bonnet, who led the research for Capgemini, said: \u201cOur research program has identified a class of companies \u2013 the digirati \u2013 who outperform all others to a considerable degree. These companies are outperforming their peers in every industry that we have studied. <\/p><p>Research for the report, \u201cThe Digital Advantage: How digital leaders outperform their peers in every industry\u201d, was conducted over two years and based on responses from more than 400 major global companies.<\/p><p>It suggests that digital maturity consists of two dimensions \u2013 digital intensity (the \u201cwhat\u201d) and transformation management intensity (the \u201chow\u201d). In other words, what the firm is doing with digital technologies and how the firm is managing the process of transformation, particularly companies that are mature in both dimensions, generate the most digital advantage.<\/p><p>Significantly the researchers found that digital maturity matters in every sector, from high tech to more traditional bricks-and-mortar industries. The study also found that while there are different maturity levels by sector, there are digital leaders in all of them who are currently outperforming their peers. <\/p><p>Among the digital pioneers identified in the report are Burberry, Prisa, Asian Paints and L\u2019Or\u00e9al. When Angela Ahrendts, Burberry\u2019s chief executive, took over in 2006 she launched a significant transformation project covering multiple business areas, from customer experience to operational excellence, largely driven by digital technologies. \u201cDigital has been a catalyst for everything in the company and when we got everyone on board with this concept, they were clamouring to become even more connected,\u201d Ms Ahrendts told the researchers.<\/p><p>Not surprisingly perhaps, the study found the highest percentage of corporate Digirati in the high-technology (38 per cent), banking (35 per cent), travel and hospitality (31 per cent), insurance (33 per cent) and telecom (30 per cent) industries. It also revealed that Digirati exist within packaged goods (24 per cent), utilities (20 per cent), retail (26 per cent), manufacturing (12 per cent), and pharmaceuticals (7 per cent), although these sectors are less advanced.<\/p><p>Capgemini suggests that the approach that digitally mature companies use can be adopted by any company that has the leadership drive to do so. Specifically, the research identified common patterns for how the leading companies build their digital advantage \u2013 a \u201cdigital DNA\u201d.<\/p><p>First, the corporate digirati significantly invest in the \u201chow\u201d of digital transformation. They build and share a digital vision with their workforce, implement proper digital governance structures to ensure ownership and accountability of the transformation, invest in a training and build strong relationships between the business and IT\/technology functions. <\/p><p>Second, they make clear choices on what to transform, concentrating investment based on their own strengths and the dynamics of their competitors. For example, some excel in process digitisation with a strong emphasis on analytics and internal collaboration, while others select customer experience excellence through channel integration.<\/p><p>George Westerman, the research scientist who led the study for MIT, said: \u201cAchieving a digital advantage requires more than sheer digital investment. It requires building the leadership frameworks to envision and drive transformation. Digital transformation is as much about leadership and organisational change as it is about implementing new technologies.<\/p><p>\u201cIt is therefore a top-down exercise requiring skills and influence that only senior leaders possess. Although there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 for digital transformation, we have identified common patterns for how successful companies have built their digital advantage. All leaders can use this digital DNA to help their businesses gain a digital advantage. However, both leaders and laggards need to recognise that this is a process of constant reinvention.\u201d<\/p>"},{"id":"33722681","uuid":"86f29dae-2770-11e2-8c4f-00144feabdc0","title":"Europe wheat gains on harvest fears","catid":"8","byline":"By Jack Farchy","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 22:03:17 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/86f29dae-2770-11e2-8c4f-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"Three-and-a-half month record reached as weather ravages crop and as prospect of dwindling exports from former Soviet Union strains supplies","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Commodities"},"share":{"webappemail":"RNtdHV","webappshare":"PSo1Y7"},"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 22:03:17 +0000","content":"<p>European wheat prices rose to their highest level in three-and-a-half months yesterday as the prospect of dwindling exports from the former Soviet Union strained supplies elsewhere.<\/p><p>Benchmark milling wheat futures for January delivery in Paris touched \u20ac270 a tonne for the first time since July, when the market was still trying to calibrate the impact of the US drought.<\/p><p>The price of the grain, used to make bread, is approaching its highest level since the Russian drought of 2010 and is less than 10 per cent below the record high of 2007.<\/p><p>While this year\u2019s US wheat crop has been less badly affected by the drought than corn or soyabeans, wheat harvests in other big northern hemisphere exporters such as Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and the UK have also suffered at the hands of the weather.<\/p><p>Russia, for example, is due to bring in its smallest wheat harvest in nine years at just 38m tonnes \u2013 less than in the drought-ravaged summer of 2010.<\/p><p>The lower production means that traders expect minimal sales from the former Soviet Union region, which accounts for about a fifth of global exports, after the end of this month.

Mr Obama is seen as likely to keep to the status quo of accommodative policy, regardless of whether Ben Bernanke wants to stay when his term expires in 2014. That is positive for T-bonds. Conversely, monetary policy could turn more hawkish if a President Romney gets to name the next Fed chief.

If Republicans keep control of the House, as pollsters predict, Mr Romney is seen as more likely to avoid the growth-killing $600bn in tax hikes and spending cuts entailed by the fiscal cliff.<\/p><p>Why might the obvious be wrong? The race has been so tight that stocks might just rally to year-end in relief regardless of who wins.

But it has been worse still if a Republican wins. Since 1953, post-election years under Republicans (two up and seven down) compare unfavourably with those under Democrats (five up and one down). The comeuppance arrives in year two when Democrat White Houses lag behind Republican ones. But all bets are off if the acrimony of the campaign was just a prelude to a tie or a contested result.

At first The Netflix Story was an excellent thriller (for viewers able to suspend disbelief in such things as valuation). The stock rose inexorably until mid-2011. The plot turned to horror after an ill-timed price increase, an insane rebranding effort and a pricey foray into new markets. The stock crashed in 2011\u2019s second half. One last shock came in 2012, when the company missed its subscriber growth target.<\/p><p>Now the screwball comedy phase has begun. It came out last week that activist investor\/lovable goofball Carl Icahn had bought about 10 per cent of Netflix stock. He argues that Netflix is undervalued and could be of interest to a bigger acquirer. Mr Icahn is probably wrong if he thinks the shares are too cheap. But, given low entry barriers and the economic interest content makers have in keeping first-rate programming off Netflix, he may be right that the business is worth more to a company using video streaming as a customer retention tool (as Amazon does) than on its own. <\/p><p>Netflix\u2019s response to Mr Icahn was to institute a poison pill defence designed to dilute anyone acquiring more than 10 per cent of the shares. This is silly. Netflix, with its shares down 75 per cent from their peak, is in no position to discourage activists and if Mr Icahn thinks he can find a buyer willing to pay over the odds, terrific.<\/p><p>So, one hopes, in the next reel the movie becomes a romantic comedy. Netflix may not be interested in love but, hopefully, that will not stop a rich, bumbling suitor (Microsoft?) from declaring that it cannot live without video content to augment its other offerings, prompting an irresistible offer. The alternative is that the defensiveness of Netflix\u2019s management and board leaves it with nothing to offer investors but a snazzy song-and-dance number before the lights, at last, come up.<\/p><p>Email the Lex team in confidence at <a onclick=\"if (mFT.mailto) return mFT.mailto('lex@ft.com')\" href=\"mailto:lex@ft.com\">lex@ft.com<\/a><\/p>"},{"id":"33723291","uuid":"96146d00-2796-11e2-8c4f-00144feabdc0","title":"Nike nears deal to sell Cole Haan","catid":"60","byline":"By David Gelles in New York","datepublished":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 23:49:01 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/96146d00-2796-11e2-8c4f-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"The sports apparel company is nearing a deal to sell its lossmaking Cole Haan shoe and bag brand to private equity firm Apax Partners for about $500m","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Retail"},"share":{"webappemail":"PSw8nu","webappshare":"TGPICn"},"stocks":{"us:NKE":"Nike Inc"},"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Mon, 05 Nov 2012 23:49:01 +0000","content":"<p>Nike is nearing a deal to sell its lossmaking Cole Haan shoe and bag brand to private equity firm Apax Partners for about $500m, according to people familiar with the matter. <\/p><p>A deal was not expected to be announced on Tuesday, when US voters go to the polls, but could come soon. <\/p><p>Apax, based in London, has partnered with Jack Boys, former chief executive of Converse, who is expected to run the company after it is bought from Nike.

For chief executives, the value of vested LTIPs reached \u00a31.6m.<\/p><p>LTIPs are designed to incentivise directors over a long-term period, typically three years. They are usually granted in the form of shares and are closely linked to shareholder returns.<\/p><p>Mr Tatton said many LTIPs were based on comparative performance with competitors, meaning directors stand to gain even if their company\u2019s performance has worsened \u2013 as long as their chosen peer group has done even worse.<\/p><p>The maximum value of share grants has been steadily increasing.

The FRC oversees today\u2019s code, which evolved from the Cadbury reforms.<\/p><p>Lady Hogg, chairwoman of the FRC, says that standards in the UK have resonated around the world since the Cadbury code was launched in December 1992. <\/p><p>\u201cCodes have been introduced in countries as different as Switzerland and Bangladesh,\u201d Lady Hogg says. \u201cThe code has made a big difference to our corporate culture, and continues to do so. <\/p><p>\u201cCompanies, on the whole,\u201d she added, \u201cwant to comply with agreed best practice, even when their initial instinct may be against change.\u201d <\/p><p>To mark the anniversary, the FRC has also published a selection of essays from senior UK business people, reflecting on the reforms. It includes contributions from Sir Adrian, Chris Gibson-Smith, chairman of the London Stock Exchange Group, Sir Roger Carr, chairman of Centrica and president of the Confederation of British Industry, and Keith Skeoch, chief executive of Standard Life Investments.<\/p><p>At the heart of today\u2019s corporate governance code is a \u201ccomply or explain\u201d approach that avoids binding laws. Companies must comply with guidelines on matters such as remuneration and board independence, or explain why they have not.<\/p><p>\u201cThis policy [comply or explain] had a profound impact on worldwide corporate governance,\u201d says Sir Adrian. \u201cIt became a principle, a watershed in thinking, which has endured in academia, regulation and practice.\u201d<\/p><p>Sir Roger argues that it has succeeded where other approaches have failed. \u201cIn the UK, we have been wise to adopt the principle of code not law, and \u2018comply or explain\u2019 \u2013 a far cry from the American and European focus on legislation, which has often brought bureaucracy and cost rather than resolution,\u201d he says.<\/p><p>Since Sir Adrian published his report, there have been numerous reviews, introducing further reforms that have been incorporated into today\u2019s corporate governance code. <\/p><p>Lady Hogg singles out annual elections for directors and separating the roles of chief executive and chairman as two of the most important measures.<\/p><p>She argues that elections for directors have put pressure on companies to link remuneration and performance \u2013 which culminated in high-profile rebellions over pay this spring. <\/p><p>Other important principles, she says, include having at least three non-executive directors on a board.<\/p><p>However, some investors emphasise that improving standards has further to go. Jim Stride, the head of UK equities at Axa Investment Managers, says: \u201cNot every company has good governance and there is still improvement needed at some institutions on remuneration, board structure and independence of directors.\u201d<\/p><p>Others suggest that controversies at Bumi and Eurasian Natural Resources Corp, the mining groups, show that progress still needs to be made in reining in dominant shareholders and ensuring that companies listed in London are run in a transparent and fair way. <\/p><p>However, fund managers acknowledge that the Cadbury code has not only improved companies\u2019 policies on transparency and remuneration but also enhanced their market value.<\/p><p>As Mr Stride says: \u201cCompanies with the best corporate governance tend to be the ones with the best performance.\u201d<\/p><p>The FRC remains wary of allowing standards to slip \u2013 and has criticised a move to dilute a European Commission reform that would oblige listed companies to change audit firms at least once every six to 12 years.<\/p><p>The European Parliament has discussed the possibility of extending this maximum tenure to 25 years. \u201cRotation every 25 years, once a generation, doesn\u2019t seem to us effective in any respect,\u201d says Lady Hogg. <\/p><p>As lead regulator for the UK accountancy profession, the FRC prefers the measure it has introduced in the UK. This obliges larger, publicly traded companies to put their audit contract out to tender at least once a decade \u2013 or explain to shareholders why they have not done so.<\/p>"},{"id":"33723841","uuid":"64ffd934-275f-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0","title":"Boom in online shopping lifts DPD","catid":"46","byline":"By Mark Wembridge","datepublished":"Tue, 06 Nov 2012 00:12:02 +0000","guid":"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/64ffd934-275f-11e2-abcb-00144feabdc0.html","snip":"The parcel delivery group has pledged to spend \u00a3175m to expand its UK capacity amid growing demand and to upgrade its IT and GPS systems","details":{"metadata":{"primarySectionName":"Support Services"},"share":{"webappemail":"SuVvHZ","webappshare":"PSzMxD"},"stocks":{"uk:ASC":"ASOS PLC"},"storypackage":[]},"mediaAssets":null,"date":"Tue, 06 Nov 2012 00:12:02 +0000","content":"<p>As many as 1,500 full-time jobs are to be created in the East Midlands by DPD, the parcel delivery group, which has pledged to spend \u00a3175m to expand its UK capacity to cope with growing demand for retail goods ordered online.<\/p><p>DPD, a British parcel delivery subsidiary of France\u2019s La Poste, the second largest postal group in Europe by revenues, will on Tuesday commit \u00a3175m over the next five years to build its fourth delivery hub in the UK, add 10 new branch depots, and upgrade its IT and GPS systems.<\/p><p>The delivery group has benefited from the rise of online retailing in the UK, as customers increasingly avoid high street outlets in favour of goods bought over the internet.<\/p><p>The expansion follows a similar move by Royal Mail Group, which committed to spend \u00a375m over four years on its UK express parcels business, creating some 1,000 jobs. Royal Mail said last week it would open a new parcel processing centre in Chorley, Lancashire, next year, and two new depots in Cornwall and Hampshire.<\/p><p>DPD is expanding to follow the shift from traditional business-to-business parcel delivery towards consumer-focused groups such as Asos, the fast-growing online clothing retailer, and Amazon.<\/p><p>\u201cPeople love to shop online \u2013 we backed the right horse in 2006 when we chose to target e-commerce,\u201d said Dwain McDonald, chief executive of DPD.<\/p><p>Mr McDonald said that the adoption of a GPS-based technology called Predict \u2013 which sends customers an email or text outlining a one-hour window for an expected delivery time \u2013 had proved crucial to the group\u2019s UK expansion.<\/p><p>\u201cWith Predict we have a product that gives retailers greater confidence that their goods can be delivered both on time and straight into the hands of their customers.
